  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Burma (Myanmar) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; BHM supports community-based backpack medics who administer village health care services in Burma, grassroots education projects that empower the youth of Burma and projects that promote cross-cultural sharing and collaboration for refugees from Burma living in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Burma has one the world’s worst health care systems, with some of the highest rates of malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, dysentery, diarrhea and other communicable illnesses in the world. In the ethnic conflict areas of Burma, the government provides no healthcare. 15% of children die before their 5th birthday, mostly from illnesses that are easily preventable. Malaria accounts for nearly half of all deaths. 1 in 12 expecting mothers will not survive pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the election of Aung San Suu Ky&#039;s National League for Democracy to hold the majority of seats in parlimant, the Myanmar Army continues its assaults on the ethnic minorities. The Army attacks villages, killing citizens, burning crops and seizing land for international development. Rape is used as a weapon of war to intimidate communities. 650,000 people are internally displaced and at least twice as many are isolated without infrastructure. Others have fled the country, living in refugee camps or as undocumented workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; This project is ingeniously navigating a hostile regime and a difficult physical environment to provide grassroots, culturally integrated health care - and thus elegantly meeting critical needs. Trained in basic neo-natal care and childbirth, plus equipped with medicine, Backpack Medics travel among their people providing pre-natal, delivery, and post-delivery care. The ethnic medics speak their people providing pre-natal, delivery, and post-delivery care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our efforts start with supporting BPHWT to recruit and train the next generation of backpack medics.  These dedicated men and women learn the basics of first aid, medicines, maternal and child care and community health practices during a 7 month training program in a safe area of Karen State. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teams draw volunteers from all the ethnic groups in Burma to include the Karen, Karenni, Kachin, Palaung, Shan and Mon people. The priority goes to assisting those communities immediately affected by the Burma army’s violence or aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once trained, the new medics return to their villages and communities.  Some serve for a few years while others serve for decades. No matter how long they serve, BHM supports them with their required medicines and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backpack medics are instrumental as catalysts of change for their people.  The isolated villages and IDP camps lack the amenities of contemporary society – electricity, running water, paved roads and fixed structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medics provide a very proactive community health education program.  Their efforts focus on disease prevention for the most prevalent conditions:  malaria, dysentery, pneumonia and problem pregnancies.  They also promote sanitary conditions with securing clean water and building and instructing on how to build latrines.  The medics also share information on malnutrition, waste disposal, Vitamin A, de-worming medicine, and high-risk pregnancies. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>GravityLight</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/gravitylight</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Over 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity and millions more have unreliable supply. Instead they rely on dangerous, polluting and expensive kerosene lamps for light. GravityLight transforms the pull of gravity into electricity. It&#039;s a unique solution designed as an affordable, safe and reliable alternative.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;A typical kerosene lamp resembles a Molotov cocktail - a bottle or tin can, fuel and wick. It&#039;s an extremely dangerous and polluting combination that consumes 20% of a family&#039;s income, ongoing, locking them into a cycle of energy poverty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Kerosene lamps are also a significant cause of health issues and burns: the WHO equates these fumes to smoking 40 cigarettes a day and, in India alone, 1.5 million people suffer burns due to overturned kerosene lamps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Furthermore, kerosene lamps are responsible for 3% of global CO2 emissions and emit significant amounts of black carbon, equivalent to a quarter of global diesel emissions, annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; GravityLight is a low-cost, safe, clean and reliable alternative. GravityLight pays for itself within 3 months of switching from kerosene and saves families money thereafter. Children have more, healthier light to study by and parents to work by, in turn increasing educational attainment and earnings whilst reducing smoke related illnesses. All this leads to increased disposable income and empowers families to break free from a cycle of energy poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The majority of off-grid households are based in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where The GravityLight Foundation is partnering with local organisations to reach the largest number possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;GravityLight is an innovative approach to off-grid power that creates a new category of off-grid lighting. It takes seconds to lift a weight that provides 25 minutes of light on its descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; GravityLight can be used anytime, repeatedly. With no need for batteries or the sun, it is unique in that it can be stored indefinitely and used in any country, whatever the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; GravityLight has been designed with off-grid households, typically living on $2.50 /day in mind. As such, all unnecessary costs have been ruthlessly designed out, whilst balancing the need for an elegant yet robust product used in a range of different situations and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A global field trial among off-grid households in 26 different countries was conducted to test the concept, demand and feasibility of GravityLight. Over 90% of triallists said they would use one instead of a kerosene lamp and also provided invaluable feedback which has been integrated into an improved version due to be launched this Autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; To establish a sustainable model, GravityLights will be sold through local distribution networks making a living from selling GravityLights and similar clean energy products, throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sacred Groves</title>

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Auroville, India&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;SacredGroves works to create a true shift in the design and construction of high-density housing projects. Our strategy is to weave forestry, agriculture, community spaces and off-the-grid services (power/water/passive-cooling/bio-gas/eco-sanitation) along-with row housing built using natural &amp;amp; recycled materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Eco-Housing with dignified community-living, affordable for all, is our dream!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;India is rapidly urbanizing. While village/ tribal people settle into cities they are forced to live an urban lifestyle often in tightly crammed dwellings with inadequate water, power and sanitation. Their innate skills of farming and forestry slowly atrophy. Their sense of personal worth and dignity erodes away the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The situation of the city-born is no different. They live in concrete mansions with power &amp;amp; money guzzling lifestyles. This further pushes them into the debt-trap set by banks and other money-lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The need to develop ecological but affordable housing with safe sanitation and reliable building services for the urban masses, is very critical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Construction of buildings devours more than 60% of the world&#039;s natural resources. Rivers are mined for sand, mountains downed for stone and wetlands filled in with construction wastes. We have discovered that simply by recycling construction rubble into an earth-based concrete we could potentially save most of our rivers, hills and wetlands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Working solely with recycled non-toxic building materials and natural materials harvested from the site we could also create buildings with very low embodied energy. Integrating farming and forestry into housing, fresh urban migrants could continue to practice their age-old occupations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;SacredGroves is a new holistic approach to city planning synthesizing the most ecological options in housing, forestry, agriculture, agro-forestry, sanitation, rainwater harvesting, wastewater treatment/recycling &amp;amp; eco-energy generation/distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; SacredGroves is based in Auroville International Township (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.auroville.org&quot;&gt;www.auroville.org&lt;/a&gt;) in India- a community aspiring to bring alive the ideal of Human Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; SacredGroves houses-gardens are built with natural and safely recyclable materials. All site systems are off-the-grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There are large scale rainwater harvesting structures built-in with the houses averaging 150,000 liters water storage per house. Only dry composting toilets are used. Greywater is recycled two times between the house and the attached vegetable garden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Energy is produced on-site with a Solar/Wind/Biodiesel hybrid system. This would ensure a uninterrupted flow of good quality power to the people. The houses themselves are fitted with locally hand-made data-logging and remote-switching devices (Wattmon-&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wattmon.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.wattmon.com/&lt;/a&gt;) interconnected with a simple micro-grid. This local power grid would allow for energy sharing across the housing estate based on demand and supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The affordability of the same is ensured by the use of site-harvested building materials like sub-soil earth, bamboo and other freely available recycled materials like construction rubble. The building technology is kept deliberately simple so that volunteer builders can be employed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Wello</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2012/wello</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; India&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Wello is a social venture with an ambitious goal: To deliver clean water to a thirsty world. We design and deliver affordable innovations that save time and increase opportunities for people who lack access to water. We design products that people not only need, but want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; For 1 in 6 people in India, access to water requires hours of walking, waiting in line and heavy lifting of water containers. The time spent fulfilling this basic need keeps many children out of school and prevents women from carrying out all the domestic and income generating work for which they are responsible. Moreover, the traditional method of carrying water – carrying a 5 gallon (20 liter) water bucket on the head–can severely damage the spine, causing severe pain and even leading to complications during childbirth. Looking at all of this we at Wello Water aim to solve the plight of access to potable water by producing the WaterWheel which makes carrying water easier. It frees up valuable time of the women folk and children, and in the process, removes barriers that prevents children from going to school and empowers women to engage in more productive activities. Research shows that when women have extra time, they choose to spend it on activities that boost family income, education, health, and wellbeing and thus resulting in eradicating poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Designed by Cynthia Koening and Shradha Rao, the WaterWheel pilot project was launched in May 2015, and the first commercial sale of the product took place in the tribal village of Rajasthan. Teaming up with HDFC Bank, Wello Water have made the WaterWheel available to 12 000 more people in the most remote parts of India. By reframing the water crisis as an opportunity, we at Wello have reinvented the wheel and developed an innovative business model that empowers individuals to use the WaterWheel as an income-generating tool to lift their families out of poverty. In a single trip, the Water Wheel is able to carry sufficient water for a family of five. Women spend over 25% of their time each day collecting water. With the WaterWheel, they can now transport 50 litre at once – almost 3 to 5 times more amount of water possible as compared to the traditional methods. We also know that the people who need the WaterWheel the most have the least ability to pay for it. And so we provide these wheels at an affordable price.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>G-pod</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/g-pod</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; SPARK Architects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Australia, China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; G-Pod is a building system, with each individual pod&#039;s being capable of functioning autonomously or able to be interlinked with others to form more consolidated structures. G-pods, in both single and multi pod configurations, are readily deployable and can be easily dismantled, restructured, reused and re-located with minimal environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Our “business as normal&quot;&quot; approach to the construction of the built environment (our habitat) is incredibly energy hungry, environmentally destructive, inflexible - generally singular in function and, with respect to the life expectancy of modern buildings, significantly wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Humanity needs to embrace and evolve new ways of providing habitat for our species that ultimately works in harmony with the natural world, and this need is real and urgent. Climate Change and the undeniable degradation of our natural environment is most certainly the catalyst for such an approach. It is also, arguably, related to the planet experiencing an increase in extreme weather events and the resulting humanitarian disasters. Increases in refugee movement as a consequence of disaster, warfare and viruses such as Ebola has resulted in unprecedented demands on global aid and humanitarian organisations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Within the pursuit of a more holistic approach to the construction of our built environment is also the critical need for a system of rapidly deployable, autonomous buildings to serve humanitarian and post catastrophe needs. Buildings that are robust, flexible in use and scalable for specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; G-pod is a “system within a system&quot; and is intrinsically capable of providing “solutions within solutions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;G-Pod is a globally transportable, rapidly deployable building solution based on the structural and dimensional tolerances of ISO shipping containers. Through a series of mechanical (manual or automated) moves G-pods expand up to three times their original footprint and through the &#039;in pod&#039; incorporation of auxiliary elements provide a high level of amenity for all climate types. G-pods have the ability to generate and store their own electricity, collect and store their own rain water and treat waste water. The G-pod system allows for individual, stand alone pods, or the networking and consolidation of several or many pods into larger buildings and even tower structures.&lt;br /&gt;
 The G-Pod building system, can evolve, contract or expand to specific needs, both temporary and permanent. Pods can be added or subtracted as user needs change and entire configurations can be easily relocated to another site or whole or part can be re-purposed for other needs and or locations. The system allows our built environment to behave in a more organic manner with respect to the needs of the individual, and the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G-pods will be manufactured in Guangzhao China and can be sited anywhere in the world that you can position a shipping container.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bamboo Composite Reinforcement</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/bamboo-composite-reinforcement</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Alternative Construction Material Group at the Future Cities Laboratory Singapore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Singapore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The objective of this project is to replace the conventional steel reinforcement in structural concrete by newly developed bamboo composite materials. Steel production is pricey, energy consuming and only available in developed countries. Therefore, all developing countries have to rely on steel imports, which make building construction rather costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Developing countries around the world are in continuous demand for construction materials specifically steel in the form of reinforcement for reinforced concrete structures. Countries like Ethiopia in Africa, Indonesia in Asia and Columbia in Latin America are some of the largest importers of construction steel. Unfortunately, these countries do not have any steel production facilities and the fast pace of development in these regions has led to large trade deficits over the past years. Therefore, the governments in developing countries are looking into alternatives to replace the conventional steel reinforcement. The good news for these countries is the fact that the natural habitat of bamboo is located within these regions. Bamboo is an incredibly rapid growing, affordable and locally available natural resource, with outstanding constructive qualities, which makes bamboo a great alternative to steel. The new technology developed by the research team at Chair of Architecture and Construction at Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore and Zurich transforms bamboo from only a grass into a new product called Bamboo Composite Materials. The new technology maintains the outstanding properties of raw bamboo and protects the long-term durability of reinforcements produced with this technique&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Bamboo is a type of grass, which grows to almost a meter per day. It is an inexpensive and locally available natural resource within equator zone where most of the developing countries are located. The research is exploring the creation of a bamboo composite material, which is corrosion-free, lighter and more affordable than steel and comes from a renewable, organic resource. In this new technology developed by the research team, bamboo culms are processed into fibres; fibres are mixed with a green epoxy system, pressed with a hot press machine and turned into familiar shapes and forms in which steel and timber are produced. Preliminary testing and evaluations have been carried out in our research lab in Singapore and the results were promising in terms of both mechanical and physical properties required for construction industry. In the next phase of the research, bamboo composite reinforcements will be put in structural grade concrete to measure the load bearing capacity in a beam structure and from there large-scale tests will be designed. The necessary physical durability tests such as water absorption, fire test and creep behavior will be performed to enhance the interphase between bamboo composite reinforcement and concrete in large-scale applications&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Clean Irrigation Solution</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2014/clean-irrigation-solution</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; iDE’s Clean Irrigation Solution (CIS) system increases smallholder farmers’ agricultural productivity in developing countries by offering an affordable, appropriately designed, and desirable clean energy alternative to fossil-fuel pumps. Irrigating during the dry season increases food security and allows farmers to escape the cycle of subsistence poverty by increasing their income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Of the 1.1 billion people in the world living on less than $1 per day, 800 million are subsistence farmers, many of whom lift and haul over four tons of water daily to irrigate their crops. The inability to increase their farm productivity, and consequently their income, locks these families into subsistence poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers can drastically decrease their manual labor and expand their irrigable area by employing motorized pumps. Unfortunately, the most accessible options are inefficient fossil fuel-powered pumps, which result in high levels of greenhouse gas emissions and high fuel costs. They are often oversized and poorly matched to farmer needs, resulting in overwatering and soil erosion. In India, there are more than 16 million of these pumps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FAO estimates that by 2050 we will have to produce 70% more food to support human life. Smallholder farmers play a critical role, producing 80% of the food consumed in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. To fill the food gap, smallholders will need increasing access to energy sources for crop production. With the constraints and limitations of traditional energy sources, widespread use of the CIS system will help to fill the need for food while reducing the use of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The CIS system centers around an efficient, versatile, low-tech, and cost-effective piston pump. The CIS can utilize energy from multiple renewable sources and convert this energy into a power source to drive the pump. This innovative clean energy pumping technology is paired with iDE’s low-cost drip irrigation system and three decades of expertise in farmer training. The combination of these key elements leads to a sustainable increase in agricultural productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through promoting cost reductions in manufacturing, continuing to make performance improvements, developing a last-mile distribution network, marketing to other organizations, and building strong partnerships with micro-financing institutions, iDE is working to bring the impact of CIS system to scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with a private sector partner, iDE is centralizing manufacturing of the product in India, allowing for scaled production to minimize product costs. iDE is introducing the CIS in three of its country programs: Zambia, Nepal, and Honduras. Product sales in these countries will follow iDE’s market-based approach. While other non-profits give products away, iDE sells, trains, and promotes products to farmers at sustainable market prices. Thus a key design principle is performance and affordability — the CIS is designed to pay for itself in less than two years.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Forests Survival Leadership</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2014/forests-survival-leadership</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; For the next 2 years we set up a network of active forest defenders through which we engage 1,000 local leaders throughout Southeast Asia. The victims of deforestation, biodiversity loss, climatic disasters, cultural and political oppresion, shall now lead the movement for survival, resilience, and recovery of forests and peoples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; The devastation of forests and peoples in Indonesia, the Philippines and throughout Southeast Asia has parallels with or may be even worse than the devastation of the economy, physical infrastructure and socio-political institutions of Europe and Japan during World War II. Vast tracts of forestlands have been decimated. Landscapes and ancestral territories have been obliterated. Forest-dependent and indigenous peoples are losing their identity, their right&#039;s to land and human dignity.  So, not only has the physical forest landscape has been devastated,  but also the social, cultural and spiritual heritage.  Again, indigenous peoples and forest peoples are the victims, losers, and most vulnerable, even more worrying now that latest study finds that the impact of climate change is worse than previously projected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forests and peoples can not wait for global talks and conventions, international aid and programs to address clear and present danger they are facing.  What is needed is not too uniform approaches, but ones that are locally tailored. This calls for a strong regional and local leadership and initiatives in making sure that landscapes, lifespaces, forests, and peoples of this region will survive through decades to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The initiative is Building Leadership towards Forests and People’s Survival in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a movement of connected thousands local leaders.  It will be about promoting investment in people and open social processes, fostering solidarity as a complementary strategy for the region’s development, creating and testing common platforms for governments, communities, and businesses in Southeast Asia, and ensuring Southeast Asia’s forests and forest peoples will sustain and flourish in the next 50 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will not be based in an office, or city, or country.  Rather, each leader and each of us will be one of many centers. One server among thousands of this region wide web.  Therefore a new way of leading, organizing, and creating changes.  It’s the social-environmental movement in the Internet era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will work initially from a small group, the team, who connects with local leaders, which in turns will identify and connect to more leaders.  Then there will be a crowd-processing-like system, can be as simple as a facebook group of these leaders, where technical and logistical support processed, ideas and information shared, activities coordinated and documented, and a movement created.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Youth for a Livable Cebu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Cebu, The Philippines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Great Urban Challenge is a multi-stakeholder approach to urban revitalisation via city-wide pocket park strategy. It aims to combat urban decay through the collaborative work of the youth, private and public sectors for cities who face economic constraints on building public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Among the world&#039;s fastest urbanizing countries, the Philippines&#039;s rapid concentration of economic development on the urban areas have massively contributed to urban decay and pollution. Moreover, the lack of properly-thought of urban planning has caused the decline of vibrant public spaces and represents a loss far deeper than simple nostalgia for quiet, comfortable living. It has become a precursor to the loss on the sense of community, increased crime rate, pollution and many more. This phenomenon is observed widely in crowded urban quarters of almost all developing Asian and African cities. Community spaces are suffering under the onslaught of misguided urban growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sustaining Asian and African economy&#039;s high-growth trajectory requires continued investment in smart infrastructure and public community spaces, however most of these governments tend to slack on urban planning. Public spaces investment has not moved at the same pace and it will soon derail the economic benefits.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The Great Urban Challenge has been addressing the concern of urban decay through the formation of pocket art parks, in line with the spirit of harnessing livability, sustainability, volunteerism and creative upcycling via gardening and farming. It understands the idea of engaging the community as the prime mover of creatively transforming their decaying spaces and it further promotes to children and the youth the importance of the natural and built environments through the creative process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The program is a multi-stakeholder initiative which calls for the local government for a city-wide program among all its districts to build pocket art parks. The initiative is a collaborative work of the community to locate a decaying space and secure permission to build the pocket art park within it. Banking on creativity and innovation, the spaces made use of recycled materials from commercial establishments and households. The spaces were no less than 25 sqm, either public or donated private space, including walls for vertical gardening. The greatest factor of the initiative was the community engagement where it harnesses volunteerism by involving the youth, children and local government employees to design and put together the art park. Each space had to be both attractive, well-appropriation of plan selections, design of energy-efficient use of tree canopies, parmeable landscaping, shady and sunny areas and appropriate maintenance plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The strength of the project is bringing together the community to work together and make a bold stand against urban decay. Each community actor plays understands the role in a holistic perspective of systems solutions, simultaneously addressing urban decay, social and environmental concerns.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Israel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; We developed a children design-oriented affordable wheelchair for less developed environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 7 million disabled children lack wheelchairs and do not have access to education. Through our affordable $100 children wheelchairs we will empower access to primary education and to future independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Current solutions for children mobility are just a &quot;&quot;size reduction&quot;&quot; of an adults solution. Our children oriented design enhances the disabled child and improves his self esteem with his peers. The $100 wheelchair is supported by rehabilitation training teams where necessary providing a comprehensive and integral community rehabilitation solution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
