 <title>Urbinsight: The EcoCitizen World Map Project</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/urbinsight-ecocitizen-world-map-project</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Ecocity Builders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Oakland, California, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Urbinsight project connects communities with web-based mapping tools designed to explore and measure holistic urban health from a citizens&#039; perspective. Based on a bottom-up approach to documenting environmental conditions at the neighborhood scale, the project provides tools, training, and knowledge for creating more sustainable, resilient urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Cities play a critical role in the quest for solutions to global environmental challenges. Recent decades have witnessed an increasing trend of concentration of the world&#039;s population in urban areas — by 2050 it is estimated that two-thirds of the world&#039;s population will live in cities. Urban areas currently account for 60% to 80% of the world&#039;s greenhouse gas emissions, and the numbers are similar for demand for water and energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; An important step in the process of addressing these challenges and creating effective solutions is the ability to understand, measure and quantify the environmental impacts of cities, in terms of consumption of energy and natural resources and generation of waste. There is a need for detailed, accurate data and information about local urban environmental conditions, as well as social and economic conditions that affect both the immediate quality of life for residents and the long-term resilience and sustainability of urban areas. Furthermore, access to such data and information is a key consideration, both for citizens (so that they can be involved in governance and action to improve environmental conditions and quality of life) and for local governments (in order to support good public policy, decision making and urban management).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Urbinsight uses GIS and online multimedia applications to graphically and spatially display information about the state of the urban ecosystem. The project is implemented in each pilot city through collaboration with local universities, community-based organizations, and government agencies. The key goals are to actively engage citizens in learning, planning, and advocating for their communities; and to provide original neighborhood-level data to complement official government data that can inform policy and decision-making for more sustainable cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urbinsight incorporates an educational component based on the &quot;EcoCompass&quot; curriculum, which includes participatory action research methods and learning forums. It also utilizes a methodology known as urban metabolism modeling, which measures the &quot;source to sink&quot; flows of resources, including water, energy and solid waste, as they move through the built environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial phase includes the creation of a base map that displays key features of the natural and built environment, as well as several urban environmental indicators (these initial data to be mapped are obtained from open government data sources). After taking part in workshops on participatory information technologies, citizens can then contribute community-generated data and upload their observations and reports about neighborhood conditions to the map via mobile phones or the web.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Soft Systems, High Grounds</title>

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; MIT Urban Risk Lab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Haiti&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; This project involves a prototypical system of disaster evacuation parks across the Caribbean country of Haiti for more than 5,000 sites of schools and markets as protective and preemptive economic infrastructures for disaster risk reduction and economic recovery against the dangers of hurricanes, severe floods, mudslides, and earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Against extreme economic and ecologic dynamics of tropical urban life in Haiti, this project proposes open spaces distributed across extreme topographies and dynamic watersheds designed to address five challenging complexities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Extreme Terrain: 80% of land in Haiti privately owned, and over 50% of the population lives in highly mountainous, poorly accessible areas, or downstream, in fertile yet floodable valley regions. Populations are unevenly distributed across a range of densities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Construction Capacity: Up until 2010, Haiti did not have a national building code. Interventions must be simple, minimal, and scalable for training and new trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Purchasing Power: the average Haitian income is between 2$ and 3$ per day. Interventions must capitalize on people&#039;s livelihoods within construction techniques that are commensurate with cultures of maintenance to avoid inequity and strife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Literacy and Legibility: nearly 50% of the population over 25 years old cannot read or write. Interventions must be easily legible, simple to understand, with highly graphic and visual methods referencing creole culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Youth Work Force: since more than 50% of the population is below 25 years old, interventions must work with youth organizations to develop and cultivate their potential through better access to education, training, and job markets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The project is based in the intensely agricultural and urban region of the Artibonite River Valley of Haiti, a major agronomic area where more than 1 million people live. Using 9 prototypical sites at 9 different elevations with 9 different population densities, the range of prototypical evacuation parks range from the coastal level at 0.00m asl, to high altitude mountain ranges at 3,000m asl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Associated with markets and schools in the river valley, a preliminary set of disaster evacuation parks are thus proposed to be developed as protective spaces against the threat of hurricanes, floods, and mudslides during the rainy season, while provide a buffer against drought and low water season. Through the synthetic design of ground access and accessibility, micro-elements such as lighting, pathways, and topography are combined with micro-infrastructures of plants and vegetation using local, construction techniques and creole craft to form dual purpose spaces for economic functions and ecologic services that grow over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; From coast to mountain, city to countryside, the project aims to be applied in areas across 5 major watersheds and river basins of the country with a population totaling 9 million people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Museo Aero Solar</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2012/museo-aero-solar</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Tomás Saraceno Studio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; This is  a flying museum and a solar sculpture made by the “Museo Aero Solar” group – an open-source international community, initiated more 8 years ago by Tomás Saraceno in conversation with Alberto Pesavento, inviting everybody to take part and to turn used plastic bags to lighter-than-air sculptures – .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Museo Aero Solar (2007–present) is an airborne form made solely from reused plastic bags. What began from the premise of a collection has unfolded to be an urgently necessary investigation on coexistence, aeronautics, and architecture, aimed to rethink the way we navigate new territories and venture beyond the rules of gravity. In a fascinating use of the platform of the museum, Museo Aero Solar shows how a collective project can emerge from individual acts, and potentially retake a polluting product and transform it into a mind-expanding material. The resulting collection―which includes more than 20,000 plastic bags culled from countries including Colombia, Cuba, France, Germany, Italy, Palestine, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, among others—brings forward an insistence to grasp the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Central America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; To address the root causes of high levels of youth migration from Central America to the United States by unleashing local youth leadership to build power, expand and deepen democracy, increase community voice, strengthen climate resilience and create new, more inclusive and equitable economies in Central America&#039;s Northern Triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The world&#039;s most vulnerable regions and poorest communities such as in Central America sit on the frontlines of increasing planet vulnerability, growing strain on economic, political and social systems and unprecedented deterioration in air, water and land quality. Within Central America, the countries of the Northern Triangle Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras äóñ are amongst the most vulnerable. Plagued by overwhelming social, environmental and economic issues, increased pressure from climate change places stability, peace and prosperity at great risk.&lt;br /&gt;
 With over 65% of the population under 30 years of age, the future is bleak for the next generation. More than one million of these youth are neither in school, nor employed. For them, contemplating a future at home is contemplating a future without hope.&lt;br /&gt;
 Investing in youth opportunity while simultaneously finding creative ways to address the sustainability crisis is essential to providing youth with a reason not to migrate. If action is not taken to address the root cause of migration while simultaneously building climate resilience, the United States and Central America äóñ this unique region of interwoven lives, economies, food sheds and cultures äóñ could end up facing a tragic humanitarian crisis in the years to come.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;SERES seeks to address the root causes of youth migration from the Northern Triangle to the United States by unleashing local youth leadership to build power, expand and deepen democracy, increase community voice, strengthen climate resilience and create new, more inclusive and equitable economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas many see the Northern Triangle youth bulge as a problem, we see it as an opportunity. By providing young people with training and building a youth network, SERES simultaneously galvanizes the potential of the youth bulge while creating new activated leaders and entrepreneurs. Combining transformative leadership with sustainability education and capacity building, the programs inspire and equip individuals to take action, increase their capacity, confidence and impact as young change agents, and strengthens the pathway for youth to achieve these ambitious goals and forge ahead within a supportive network of emerging leaders in the Northern Triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The programs consist of a series of multi-day modules, using a funnel model that channels participants to further training and leadership development opportunities. Entry-level provides easy access to participants, and more commitment and participation is required as they move deeper into the funnel. Youth from the Activator level onward provide mentoring and facilitation at the lower levels, helping to provide both horizontal and vertical support for youth within the network and strengthen the youth-led initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+ Leader: 3-day non-residential. Topics include: contextual understanding of social/environmental/economic framework, community visioning, collaboration and shared leadership, goal setting, project planning&lt;br /&gt;
+ Change Maker: 5-day residential. Topics include: leadership development, life skills, peer-to-peer networking and exchange, personal discovery&lt;br /&gt;
+ Activator: 7-day residential. Topics include: facilitation, communication, strategic questioning, appreciative leadership, critical thinking, mentoring&lt;br /&gt;
+ Ambassador: 5-day residential. Topics include: community organizing, systems transformation, effective leadership, embodied leadership, knowledge brokering, social capital&lt;br /&gt;
+ Entrepreneur: 5-day residential. Topics include: technical capacity building, social innovation, entrepreneurship and project management, deep ecology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Multi-family Social Housing</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2016/multi-family-social-housing</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Simón Vélez Studio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Colombia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Objective: to develop an alternative solution to social housing here in Colombia while fostering a greener (more vegetarian and less mineral) construction industry. We aim to integrate more the agriculture industry (especially bamboo and engineered bamboo products) in the construction industry, while simultaneously promoting higher standards for social housing design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Construction in concrete as conceived in the third world produces cavernous spaces: a cave has a stone floor, stone walls and a stone roof. We do not come from caves, we are dwellers, we come from the trees and we are men of the treetops, even if we do now live in caves. Current architecture follows an exaggerated and unhealthy regimen. It is totally carnivorous. The state of nature demands that we come back to a more balanced, more vegetarian state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Social housing is one of the deepest felt needs in Colombia. Not only is there a housing deficit but the current standards for social housing are subpar. Undersized cement box housing structures with simple asbestos roofing (absurdly, still legal to produce here in Colombia) form residential ghettos. They are poorly planned, deteriorated and unsafe. The oversimplification of the housing problem and the proliferation of mineral architecture (overuse of concrete, drywall, asbestos roofing/ceiling) as well as the purposeful rejection of vernacular architecture and local culture, is an unhealthy and unfortunately dominant approach to building here in the tropics. The high economic and social costs generated by low quality housing are very real dangers felt by the wider society.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Visiting the poorer neighborhoods of the cities you see interesting spontaneous and illegal constructions. They start as invasions promoted by left wing politicians who are only looking to get rich. They rezone rural land into urban land before any design for services and infrastructure. The new inhabitants take possession of the terrain and they inhabit them with their numerous families. In less than one week they create habitable spaces with cardboard boxes, cans and wood. The width of the building side facing the street is never more than 6 meters, and the depth is usually between 10 and 12 meters. They respect an area for a road that may or may not one day have services of water, sewage system and electricity. If they have luck it will be paved. Within five years all of these lots have little buildings of 4 or 5 stories, with each story being slightly bigger (about 30 centimeters) than the one underneath.These constructions are of concrete and brick and made without any respect to the norms of seismic resistance in Colombia building code. When we have a large earthquake, the tragedy will be apocalyptic. With our social housing prototype of 4 stories, we try to made a scaleable model of mix material and composite construction using concrete, steel, bamboo culms and laminated bamboo, and clay tile artisanal roof that creates a safety against earthquakes and fires. The small buildings of the 4 stories will be always be free standing and separated from all four sides. I invite you to see the attachments to this application where we demonstrate visualizations and technical drawings of the first iteration of the building prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Communitere</title>

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Communitere builds capacity and community for holistic recovery in developing world post-disaster scenarios. Our inclusive design, maker-oriented ethos lifts all stakeholders in a process resulting in a locally-owned resource for those impacted by disaster to design and rebuild their own communities, and provide access to world-class advanced technology and design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The specific and systemic process that Communitere is part of improving is post-disaster relief and recovery. The &quot;&quot;traditional&quot;&quot; process is for large amounts of money to be raised from individuals, corporations and nation-states which are funnelled into multi-national, corporate-model nonprofits based in wealthy countries; those funds are then slowly drained into bureaucracies as operatives set up well-branded initiatives as dictated by a pre-conceived mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The professional aid worker ends up far more enriched than the communities the traditional responders are active in, and there is no incentive for innovation or true community cooperation at the personal level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Climate change and ongoing neoliberal international trade structures will continue to worsen the plight of poor people living in environmentally unstable areas. Resiliency and true sustainability, not surviving but living, can only be fostered if all scalar levels of society have access to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We address the critical need for communities to be able to foster their own recovery in a space that is designed to appeal to and inspire innovators from around the world, thus creating hubs of collaborative design that lead to strong communities without answering to a donor class.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Communitere International is the support organization to a growing number of independent, nationally registered and locally-run non-profits that design, construct, and operate cooperative Resource Centers (RCs). Designed to operate indefinitely, the RCs become permanent structures long after the initial flood of international aid recedes. By empowering local residents to design and run the RCs themselves, Communitere addresses several challenges at once: 1) outside groups save money that they can redirect into their own areas of expertise, 2) local communities create spaces that best serve their needs in the long run and 3) the spaces themselves naturally facilitate cross-sector communication, collaboration, and innovation. These RCs help relief agencies, private companies, NGOs, local community groups and individuals reduce overhead and create long-term development opportunities in the wake of natural disasters. Communitere operates hubs in Haiti and the Philippines and is currently building a new center in Nepal. Increasingly, RCs are being constructed from seismically-sound shipping containers, and are home to the following resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Tool lending libraries | Residential dorms | Computer labs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Makerspaces / fab labs | Co-working offices | User testing grounds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Workshops | Conference halls | Product demonstration yards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Start-ups that design products and services specifically for developing regions who lack the resources to build their own trial centers use RCs for field testing. NGOs borrow tools and space to keep their infrastructure nimble. And most importantly, local groups and individuals use the spaces. In the immediate aftermath of major catastrophes, an astonishing array of organizations and people deploy to hardest-hit areas, driving them to compete for local resources like meeting spaces, reliable internet access, tools and lodging that are hard to access amid the devastation. In addition, response efforts are often driven by the priorities and knowledge of donors and policymakers abroad, leaving local residents out of the decision-making.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>INFORMAL URBAN COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2014/informal-urban-communities-initiative</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Informal Urban Communities Initiative (IUCI) integrates design activism, education and interdisciplinary research in the slums of Lima. It deploys innovative approaches to slum-upgrading that marry participatory design with adaptive, decentralized infrastructure. Current projects focus on fog collection as an alternative water resource for agriculture, green space and ecological restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Accelerated urbanization, profound social inequity, environmental degradation, water scarcity and food insecurity are inextricably linked, defining issues of our era.  In the next 30 years, virtually all of the world population growth will take place in developing cities. In Lima, Peru more than 3 million people live in slums. They lack access to water, sanitation, adequate housing, public green space and nutritious food. Within several decades, Andean glaciers that supply much of the city’s water will melt as a result of climate change. Lima’s already insufficient water networks will likely run dry. Changing temperatures and precipitation in Peru’s agricultural regions will decrease agricultural productivity, increase urban food insecurity, undermine rural livelihoods and contribute to increasing urbanization. Rapid informal urban growth will exacerbate water shortages and further degrading the region’s few remaining ecologically intact landscapes. The IUCI is based in Lomas de Zapallal (LdZ), a slum with 27,000 residents in northern Lima. LdZ receives 10-15mm of rain per year and has very little green space. Many residents lack reliable water supplies. Although water is scarce, a blanket of fog covers LdZ for 7-9 months of the year. It has potential as an untapped water resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The IUCI consists of two primary activities; interdisciplinary design activism studios at the University of Washington and on-site programs in LdZ. During studios, students conduct virtual meetings with community members, learn about the conditions of LdZ and explore ecologically intelligent approaches to urban infrastructure and multifunctional site design. On-site activities draw upon ideas generated during studios and focus on two locations in LdZ; the PitÌÁgoras School and the Eliseo Collazos (EC) neighborhood. While on site (4-12 weeks/year), faculty, students and professionals employ an innovative emergent/convergent approach to design. They work in close collaboration with community members to articulate a vision for their future and design and implement small-scale interventions that contribute to and converge with this vision as it evolves over time.  They document project processes, products and impacts so as to improve upon them and facilitate their dissemination and replication. Projects completed at the PitÌÁgoras School include a classroom and primary and secondary school parks, plazas and walkways. Projects completed in EC include a pilot fog collection project and 29 household gardens. Current efforts are focused on the design and construction of a full scale fog collection system, a public park, urban agriculture, and ecological restoration in EC.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>LAS TRES ESPERANZAS</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2014/las-tres-esperanzas</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; We understand resources for what they are, not limited to money. We understand architecture as a tool, not existing for its own sake / not as an end in itself. Our solutions are collective; decisions are not made by one but by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Puerto Cabuyal is a community located in a coastal area of Ecuador. Around thirty families live there far from everything; the land of 40 hectares is communal property. People still trade through barter and live mainly from fishing and agriculture. A citizen from Quito had arrived in 2004 to settle in Cabuyal. He later became the community’s teacher by starting an education program to awake desire to learn. This initiative was successful in Cabuyal; more and more children were coming. Indeed the 3x4 meters school they had constructed in the beach was becoming too small. This is when he contacted us in 2009, to offer an adapted space, directly located in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Las Esperanzas (The Hopes) is a long term process initiated in 2009 and there is no expiry date. Architecture here is not only an answer to a problem it is a tool, a way to support an initiative to bring opportunities and wider scopes. The seemingly difficult context made us think differently. $200 was all people had at hand. With such a budget it was obvious that we would have to find another kind of resource and we found many. It was essential for us to take advantage of the available materials and construction knowledge of the community; this is why we used the traditional ways of building. We developed a participatory design process in which everyone has a role to play: architects, inhabitants, teacher and volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Chira Project</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2014/chira-project</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Costa Rica&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;This recycle and community center for Women Association ADATA on Chira Island, Costa Rica, includes a work and social area. Apart from recycling it will be used for environmental trainings for schoolchildren, other inhabitants and tourists, making of handicrafts from recyclables, a daycare-center for children and meeting space.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The project intends to have a positive effect on public health and the environment: presently there is no garbage collection whatsoever on the island; the 4000 inhabitants burn, bury or trash their (and the visiting tourists&#039;) solid waste on land or in the sea. Diminishing the amount of garbage on the island (source for potential diseases and pollution) was the main reason for the women from ADATA to start recollecting recyclables. Moreover, they will teach the local population about garbage separation and environmental protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third need is economically: Operational costs will be covered with the income from recyclables; the sales of handicrafts and receiving tourists will generate an additional income. This income diversification is key as 90% of the island population depends solely on artisanal fishing and strict environmental laws forbid fishing during 3 months of the year. Also, a maximum of local construction materials is used to stimulate the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the center offers a space for ADATA and other islanders to gather for meetings, events, trainings, exhibitions of handicrafts and a daycare-center. These necessities were identified via a participatory design process with gender focus; the interests of women, men, children and handicapped people are accounted for. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The project consists of the design and construction of a recycling and community center for an environmental women association (ADATA) on Chira Island in the Nicoya Gulf (Pacific Coast, Costa Rica). It includes recycling machinery and furniture to make the center operational at delivery, training of all 4000 inhabitants on recycling &amp;amp; environment, training of the women on making handicrafts from recyclables, and a daycare for their children while they are working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design is of high aesthetic and functional quality; it combines traditional ways of living with modern building techniques, integrating the use of renewable energies like daylight, rainwater and recyclables. It responds to practical and strategic needs of ADATA, achieved via a flexible feedback loop. Social spaces for the entire population are accounted for, allowing for local cultural expressions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multistakeholder approach made the project affordable: ADATA will be the owner and main user; financial and material donations were made by UNDP, NGOs, governmental institutions, private companies and crowd-funding via awareness-raising activities; technical assistance and logistic support is given by universities and companies; a manual will be elaborated by A01 and the Health Ministry to replicate the experience allover the country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE (2018):&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;We&#039;re back on site with the Recycling and Community Center in Chira. Ground works and the foundations had been built in an earlier phase. Everything related to the building and physical infrastructure of any of our projects, we refer to as hardware. The educational campaign and sensitization of the local culture to use that &quot;hardware&quot; in the most effective and efficient way is the what we refer to as &quot;software&quot;. Especially the &quot;software&quot; has been worked on throughout the last years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current construction phase is organized by our foundation (A Foundation); the local workforce is financed by the Costa Rican Ministry of Work and Social Security. We expect to finish the building as visualized in the attached render within 4 months. These months coincide with a the time when fishing is forbidden in the Gulf of Nicoya in order for the local fish stock to recover. So the construction of the center creates a good alternative income for some of the fishermen and women meanwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I would like to tell you that the Recycling and Community Center has been included in a bigger framework that we call the &quot;Chira Project&quot;. Based on an international exchange between local and abroad universities, different small-scale buildings and their respective &quot;softwares&quot; have been designed. We hope to build some of those in the near future, once the center is completed as a first physical intervention of the Chira Project. The Chira Project has first been presented in public at the Venice Biennial for Architecture in 2016.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Cooperafloresta, using both rediscovered traditional ecological knowledge and modern agricultural science, Cooperafloresta is accelerating the natural succession of flora and fauna in agriculturally degraded areas of Brazil, going further than &#039;organic agriculture&#039; and Biodynamics by using agroforestry techniques to bring major environmental and socio-economic benefits to poor rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Agriculture is a highly impactful industry today, using 80% of available fresh water, causing soil erosion, pollution and contamination of food, soil and water, also converting forests into agricultural land and so increasing deforestation, causing loss in biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, and is one of the main causes of Greenhouse Gases emissions. The ecological agroforestry method is a viable alternative to harmonize agriculture with preserving our environment, recovering forest structure, dynamics and biodiversity, generating a wide range of products with high productivity. Combining agriculture and restoration of the natural environment, is a central issue if we are to properly supply water and food globally, contributing greatly to resolve the antagonism between food production, forest and water availability, with repercussions that go far beyond local and regional context. Sucessional Agroforestry Systems (SAF) can produce food in abundance and simultaneously accelerate the process of regenerating forest life. SAF demonstrates the ability to break with the negative impacts of modern agriculture. The path followed by this revolutionary form of agriculture points to a comprehensive view of sustainability, autonomy and sovereignty of rural communities across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The actions of Cooperafloresta developed among 300 family farmers in Brazil, who manage over 1,000 ha of SAFs.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located in the Ribeira Valley, Brazil and initiated 17 years ago, Cooperafloresta (Cooperative of Agricultural Farmers of Barra do Turvo and Adrianópolis), built a new socio-economic-environmental perspective together with impoverished communities, combining traditional knowledge with technical and scientific knowhow, building a holistic system, and so exercising sustainability. These strategies and concepts take a new look at notions of efficiency and rationality, questioning the Cartesian logic and patterns of agricultural production and consumption of modern day society.                                                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of the Gaia Theory, agroforestry is a breakthrough in the practical sense of people and agriculture re-joining Nature. It is trying to understand and use the processes of natural succession, the relationships between species and the natural cycles to produce healthy foods, allowing thus increasing biodiversity and environmental conservation.&lt;br /&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                     The trajectory of this experiment is very successful, expanding from 3 to 300 families, involved and has increased from an area of 2ha to 1.000ha of SAFs. The positive impacts are numerous: soil, water, fauna and flora recovered and protected; avoiding emissions of GHGs and actually fixing carbon in to the soil; increased diversified production of food, timber, medicinal herbs; higher per family average annual income from $ 500.00 to U.S. $ 6,000.00 through the alternative and solidary markets; Recovery of traditional knowledge, cultural and integral dimension of local communities, strengthening their social organization, and developing partnerships and networks; positive impact in public policies.&lt;br /&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                     This project has touched, inspired and trained thousands of people in Brazil through the School of Agroforestry, an informal space and technical skills training facility in agroforestry, where students learn from the socialization experience of Cooperafloresta. Our larger mission is to implement Agroforestry throughout the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
