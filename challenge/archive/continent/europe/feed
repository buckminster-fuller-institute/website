 <title>The Copenhagen Wheel</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2011/copenhagen-wheel</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; A new strategy for sustainable mobility, The Copenhagen Wheel project aims to turn any city into a cycling-city. Our holistic solution is a new type of electric bike, and associated mobile applications - helps riders overcome topography and distance, fosters a cycling community, and supports long-term transportation and environmental policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Our mission is to develop new vehicles for personal transportation that offer compelling alternatives to the car. The original prototype for the Copenhagen Wheel was invented at MIT’s Senseable City Lab in partnership with the city of Copenhagen, one of the most innovative cities for biking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Cycling with the Copenhagen Wheel is the most magical ride you&#039;ll ever take. It&#039;s like riding a regular bike, but with super strength. The Wheel makes your bike an electric bicycle that synchronizes with your movements and amplifies your pedal power 10X. You go farther in less time, with less effort, and can get to places where you&#039;d usually need a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the ebike technology lives inside the brilliant red hub and connects to your smartphone. There are no buttons, wires, or external batteries. Just replace your back wheel and pedal! The Wheel&#039;s custom sensors, computers, battery and motor do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Clepsydra Urban Farming</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2011/clepsydra-urban-farming</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Clepsydra is a new building type - actually an accessory building- a vertical greenhouse that can be linked to existing or new buildings. Within the framework of answering urgent environmental and ecological challenges, Clepsydra serves as a multi-faceted urban development tool to provide food security and community life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; The concept of vertical farming is not something new, but we still seem to be a bit lethargic in adopting this practice. One of the major challenges facing vertical farming designers, is that once you build more than one floor of greenhouse, you must put systems in place to ensure that each level of the farm has the equal potential to grow food.  This means either designing rotation systems that move the crop to share the daylight needed for growth, or the installation of high cost, high energy consuming lights that simulate natural sunlight.  Clepsydra has multiple floors but addresses these challenges through passive design (utilizing the most light through the cylindrical shape of the building) as well as solar PV panels to assist in producing the energy needed to light the crops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The idea behind the design of the Clepsydra is to ensure that you do not go through much of a hassle to put up your own greenhouse structure. That hopefully will encourage more people to take up the feature. The Clepsydra can be joined to any existing home or other buildings like hospitals, schools or even commercial malls. The basic framework is put together rather quickly using industrial steel rods and avoiding welding time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-Story Clepsydra can produce food that is equivalent to 6 acres of farmland, on an average. With farmland shrinking each day thanks to our industrial and housing needs, options like these could provide a viable alternative. That said, the main intention of the Clepsydra is to eliminate the carbon emissions and resource wastage that is involved in food supply, transportation, storing, packaging and sales- from the farm to your home.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>WikiHouse Commons</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/wikihouse-commons</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; WikiHouse Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; WikiHouse is an open source building system. We are building a digital commons, where all designers, inventors &amp;amp; users collaborate to develop and share high-performance, low-cost, low-energy building solutions that are then owned by everyone. These solutions can be downloaded, locally &#039;printed&#039; and self-assembled to make sustainable, resilient, affordable homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The future is already here, it just isn&#039;t very distributed yet.&quot; — Gibson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; By 2050, 70% of the world&#039;s 9 billion population will live in cities. Those cities will have to be built without dependence on fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We do have the solutions to meet this challenge, yet the top-down industrial systems we inherited are failing to diffuse and deploy them. Even the most sustainable technology is useless if locked behind a proprietary licence, or prohibitively expensive to produce and distribute. This is especially the case in housing, where design industries expensively re-solve the same problems again and again, while reaching only 2% of the built environment. Since the industrial revolution, we have been dependent on centralised, top-down models of design and production of mass-housing: unsustainable, undemocratic and debt-heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &quot;It is easier to ship recipes than cakes and biscuits.&quot; — Keynes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In the last decade, the web transformed our information economy, from centralised to decentralised (eg Wikipedia). In the next, it could transform our industrial economy. Open design means no problem ever needs to be solved twice. Digital manufacturing puts distributed factory power into the hands of citizens and communities. Share global, print local. What does that mean for homes and neighbourhoods?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Most people&#039;s first encounter with the WikiHouse project is with the open source hardware solutions it produces. The first building technology in the system is a LEGO-like building system that can be shared online as code, uniquely adapted to its site and user, and then locally manufactured using a CNC machine costing $2000 or less. The parts are cut from standard, widely available, low-carbon sheet materials, resulting in a kit that can be assembled like a large IKEA kit. This can be built in days, even by amateurs, but provides a level of energy performance (eg: Passivhaus) which is, at present, prohibitively expensive. This initial technology is now being joined by a growing range of compatible kit solutions; for example a 3D-printed heat recovery ventilator, which can be locally manufactured with recycled materials for Î£24, but matches the performance of its Î£200 industry equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But, the deepest innovations of the WikiHouse project are not the products themselves, but the processes behind them: the operating principles, platform and protocols that allow these solutions to be shared online, then replicated and improved by an open community of designers, inventors and makers. Our proposed project initiative is to develop this digital commons.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Translated Geometries AutoShelter</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/translated-geometries-autoshelter</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Cargo Collective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Barcelona, Spain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Physical spaces are static and not optimized to their context. Our initiative is a transformable, transportable envelope able to adjust to constantly changing users&#039; needs. Offering an optimized design to environmental conditions it generates a self-sustainable system.  Thus, it constitutes a dynamic sheltering solution to evolving heterotopic spaces, like refugee-camps.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Among different potential applications, we focus on the pilot application: Shelter.&lt;br /&gt;
 There are more than 50 million displaced people worldwide, due to conflicts, climate change and natural disasters, finding shelter in refugee camps.&lt;br /&gt;
 The vast majority has poor access to energy (0.2KWh), which in turn leads to limited education, healthcare and social activities. Considering that the population of a camp can reach hundreds thousand inhabitants, the yearly cost that humanitarian agencies have to bear for diesel generators accounts for millions of dollars, which in most cases is not affordable.&lt;br /&gt;
 To avoid dependency from the authorities, displaced people seek for alternative lighting/cooking resources such as traditional biomass and kerosene, inducing irreversible environmental degradation in the surrounding area. The actual implications have to do with deforestation, air pollution (due to fire lighting and gas consumed) and deterioration of opportunities for agriculture.&lt;br /&gt;
 Another crucial problem is the poor distribution of goods and services within the camps because of inflexible planning. Long distances to schools, ration distribution and medical centers makes them inaccessible.&lt;br /&gt;
 For the aforementioned reasons, violence arises between refugees and their hosts. The lack of security and short lifespan of tents has been reported an important parameter to improve refugees&#039; dignity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Our initiative proposes an adjustable sheltering structure, which can form itself into various real-time configurations upon users&#039; needs. Its flexibility allows it to be optimized to numerous parameters such as thermal comfort, ventilation, space distribution, number of users and potential uses (households, schools, medical centers etc.). Besides that, its foldability enables easy packaging, facilitating transportation, and the modularity of the design makes it scalable. Hence our system can be reused in diverse scenarios and locations.&lt;br /&gt;
 The solution derives from the properties of an existing responsive material called Shape Memory Polymer which can be transformed, upon heating, from rigid to flexible and can memorize its initial geometry. Through placing this material in critical nodes of our structure, and actuating it with an embedded heating system, we are able to trigger its deformation. These local deformations define the final overall shape by remodeling an origami-inspired pattern through folding and unfolding. To achieve the desired forms, an external actuation force is required.&lt;br /&gt;
 The high structural performance of the aforementioned material system empowers extended applications comparing to existing lightweight-flexible systems (pneumatics and tensegrity structures).&lt;br /&gt;
 Various prototypes have been successfully tested in the laboratory (see video below) to prove the technology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Mallorca, Spain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; A revolutionary tool for realising the potential of the bio-economy and supporting local sustainable livelihoods. By combining earth observation techniques, a mobile bioreactor and an ecosystem perspective, stakeholders can understand what local bio-resources are available and how to use them sustainably to their greatest potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;In an era of resource scarcity, climate change, pollution and waste we need a step change in how we manage resources. There is huge unrealised potential in local natural resources (the bio-economy) but often we do not understand what we have and how to use it in a sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We need to be able to make informed decisions about local resources with the best possible information on availability and potential whilst understanding how use of these resources can best serve the wider system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Effective capture of resources requires a move from centralised production to a decentralised, cyclical model where local economies are resilient to future challenges such as; resource price volatility and fossil fuels scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We will support this transition by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  - Using satellite and local data to quickly and cheaply assess the bio-productivity of a given region quantitatively and qualitatively&lt;br /&gt;
  - Using a mobile bioreactor to test the potential for transforming diverse local waste streams into active ingredients for regional use.&lt;br /&gt;
  - Using these insights to support an &quot;ecosystems&quot; approach to the management of local bio-resources using cascades of material and energy use.&lt;br /&gt;
  - Using this practical experience to create a wider systemic shift in local resource management.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;We are going to showcase a new systems approach to sustainable resource management. We are going to build a smart, mobile bioreactor that can be transported to sites with plentiful resources identified by satellite data and local stakeholders. An integrated management system will show volumes of local materials and potential for bio-transformation into ingredients that are advantageous to the local economy and environmentally sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Mallorca is an island with approximately 900,000 inhabitants. Traditional agriculture generates thousands of tons of waste whilst Mallorca imports huge amounts of food and commodities to satisfy the demands of the locals and the 13 million tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We have four initial objectives:&lt;br /&gt;
  - Design and build a mobile bioreactor that will accept a range of agricultural and agro-industrial streams to study the bioconversion of agricultural wastes.&lt;br /&gt;
  - Develop an online, interactive software solution that integrates available ground data, satellite data and output data from a bioreactor to explore potential uses of agricultural wastes for transformation.&lt;br /&gt;
  - To test the idea of &quot;business functioning like an ecosystem&quot; by creating regional products for regional use e.g. cleaning materials.&lt;br /&gt;
 - To engage local farmers, businesses and entrepreneurs in assessing the potential to create a regional bio-economy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Israel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; We developed a children design-oriented affordable wheelchair for less developed environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 7 million disabled children lack wheelchairs and do not have access to education. Through our affordable $100 children wheelchairs we will empower access to primary education and to future independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Current solutions for children mobility are just a &quot;&quot;size reduction&quot;&quot; of an adults solution. Our children oriented design enhances the disabled child and improves his self esteem with his peers. The $100 wheelchair is supported by rehabilitation training teams where necessary providing a comprehensive and integral community rehabilitation solution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Fordlandia</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2016/fordlandia</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Studio Swine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Fordlandia is a initiative producing and promoting Amazonian wild rubber products. Wild Rubber is a sustainable source of income for the marginalised forest communities who can make living from the forest and in doing so protect their environment from logging and farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Natural rubber is a much overlooked essential material used for a huge variety of things in our world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rubber comes from the latex of the rubber tree native to the Amazon. Today, synthetic rubber derived from petroleum makes up over half of the total rubber market. Natural rubber is valued for its higher elasticity, density and toughness- but the vast majority comes from commercial rubber plantations in Asia. As demand for rubber increases globally, old forests across Asia are cleared for rubber plantations at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon Rainforest is the only place in the world where rubber is collected from wild rubber trees interspersed throughout natural rainforest. Every minute the equivalent of 3 football pitches is destroyed in the Amazon Rainforest for timber and land for rearing beef and soya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Poor marginalised forest communities have little power and unfortunately most industry in the rainforest is based on the destruction of the forest. Rubber tapping employs them and their whole family whilst protecting the forest by finding value in it&#039;s natural state without it&#039;s destruction. 1kg of Latex is worth more than 1kg of beef but tappers have struggled to connect with buyers, Fordlandia will make the supply chain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Solution &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect the rainforest with custodians in the form of Rubber Tappers who each patrol over 100 rubber trees a day integrated in the wild forest. In doing so they create a economy based on the vitality of the forest rather than itäó»s destruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model is simply to make a design collection, a exhibition and a film that shows the incredible potential of wild rubber both in soft and in hard vulcanised form. As well as using other sustainably harvested forest materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design collection will be available to buy to create income for the tappers, the profits from which would be invested in their the tappers themselves, basic tools to process the rubber in the field for higher quality product before it gets to a processing factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition will start at the Fashion Space Gallery in London before touring to New York and Detroit. This will raise awareness about wild rubber and show the potential of the material and social system around it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film will reach the greatest number of people. We use film to explain environmental narratives purely through visuals which has led to us connecting with a international audience. The Fordlandia film will inform and inspire others to use natural rubber and in doing connect us to the greatest bio diverse wilderness on earth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Smart Floating Farms</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2016/smart-floating-farms</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Barcelona, Spain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Implement a series of non-pollutant Multi-layered floating platforms at a local and potentially global level, which can bring healthy food production closer to dense populated areas based on clean energy. These could be located specially in areas with food-risk associated problems, lack of land ,arid regions, water scarcity, massive food imports or monsoon floodings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;By 2030, food demand is predicted to increase by 50% (70% by 2050).Some facts: traditional Farming=Wasteful water use.Many countries with massive food imports &amp;gt;80% (i.e Gulf states,Singapore,Caribbean region) generating land-grabs and transport CO2 emissions.Others with floodings like Bangladesh,other with land premium prices, water scarcity,hyper-populated ,etc.&lt;br /&gt;
We propose a modular and replicable Floating platforms project which could help improve local food production conditions in a cleaner way, implementing them in previously studied &amp;amp; selected areas of the water spaces close to many mega-cities with a physical water access (seas-lakes-rivers-reservoirs).&lt;br /&gt;
The project is meant to cause a positive impact at both local and global levels, starting in an acupuncture scale, by providing a space for communitary production(cooperative projects), with the potential of creating new emergent economies and some of the platforms also becoming automated Farm Clusters run by the use of Internet of Things (IoT). At a global scale, it could be located in different world areas, since it is a flexible initiative able to adapt its dimensions to the local food production needs(and types), actually the project has attracted the attention of people from regions/countries as different as India,Caribbean,Singapore,Gulf states,Taiwan,US,South Africa or the UK,etc.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The project is a Polyculture based solution, a highly productive floating ecosystem. Use of a Multi-layered strategy which deals with the symbiosis / combination of different existing technologies in order to produce what we need more of, fresh and healthy food closer to our home. The top level of the SFF will integrate the green energy production facilities (Photovoltaic plant- concentrated solar power (CSP) , combined with skylights). The resultant green power generated along with induction of natural sunlight, will be used for the second level layout of the hydroponic farm (growing crops) and also to run the overall facility. The waste byproducts from these crops can be further used for feeding the fishes on the lower level (Fish farming) , while the controlled waste from the fish farms can recycled as fertilizers for the hydroponic farm äóñ thus a self-sufficient cycle and recycle process.Passive and active desalination methods are considered and potential for utilizing sea-water cooled greenhouse. The facilities are structurally capable of resisting the atmospheric conditions and also allow further reinforcements if required according to the location.They will be protected in their perimeter via a series of inflatable wave protectors, thus avoiding wave risks and other climate threats.The SFF project is to be built out of well tested materials, technologies and systems, which are already in use around the globe, its all available in the market. The SFF footprint has a shape of a rectangle inspired by Asia&#039;s traditional grid-shape fish floating farms, an efficient configuration which is rational and allows for maximum space for production.We aim to start implementing smaller scale prototypes (as in a Minimum Viable project, to collect the maximum amount of validated learning ) in areas where other alternative food production initiatives are urgently required due to imports, rapid population growth, risks etc.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Nursery Fields Forever</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2016/nursery-fields-forever</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Italy, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Our project proposes an unconventional educational approach, together with the innovative space where it can be performed. It&#039;s a real hybrid between a farm and a nursery school where the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development of children is encouraged by the constant interaction with animals and plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Nowadays the absence of direct experience has completely misled children&#039;s perception of the world and of its most basic processes.&lt;br /&gt;
This appears particularly true in urban environments where children often ignore, for instance, that the milk they drink comes from living animals or that beans don&#039;t sprout in cans.&lt;br /&gt;
The dominant preschool system does not face this problem, keeping children in classrooms where plants barely peek out from the window and animals only appear in extraordinary visits.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;We feel the need of a deep reconnection with the basic, direct, slow relations that exist between mankind and nature. Hence, our project proposes a way - and a place - for this reconnection to happen since the early childhood. It&#039;s commonly known that children are inherently and intuitively curious naturalists. We believe that this innate quality should be exploited, stimulated and guided through the educational approach of the nursery of the future.&lt;br /&gt;
 This model sees the nursery as a catalyst capable of combining, along with game, nature and technique in a renovated didactic path based on three approaches: learning from nature, learning from technique, and learning from practice.&lt;br /&gt;
 Hence, the spatial definition of the nursery establishes an integration of traditional scholastic environments and experimental spaces that merge didactic and farming. Rather than merely relying on a fixed subdivision in classrooms, the daily and seasonal routine of the groups of children 2 to 5 years old unfolds along a trajectory based on natural cycles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Jellyfish Barge (JFB) is the floating modular greenhouse for Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture that generates its own fresh water and energy, using only solar power. It is an affordable, transportable and replicable solution to grow food in or near the cities without impacting on existing resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Emerging sciences, technologies and practices around food are redesigning the global food chain. Production of food needs to increase its efficiency to fulfil a growing demand (+80% by 2050, according to FAO), while supply model is shifting from macro economic efficiency to distributed resilience, with the aim of shortening distribution lines and reducing local vulnerabilities. Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture (UPA) provides such a strategy by increasing access to fresh and healthy food, reducing food miles and contributing to increase food security. In addition, UPA contributes to urban regeneration stimulating economic activities, promoting social inclusion and improving food literacy. At present, UPA provides employment and income to about 800million people and roughly 20% of the world&#039;s food. This figure is likely to increase, as urban population grows quickly. But, cities grow, demand for food increases, while per capita resources diminish, thus farming have to compete for land and water access with other activities. Where to find hectares of farmland near the cities? Where to find millions of cubic meters of fresh water per year to irrigate crops? And, even most importantly, how to fully exploit UPA potentiality to produce social and economic impact on urban communities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;JFB is a production facility for UPA, taking into account ongoing changes in the whole food chain. A typical installation (4 greenhouse modules and one zip connection module) produces 5000-6000 edible plants per month, grown in high efficient hydroponics. Water needed is extracted from the body of water where the greenhouse floats, whether salt, brackish or polluted water. All the need for energy is fulfilled by sun power. Thus, JFB doesn&#039;t impact on existing land, water and energy resources of the city. It just expands the capacity of the urban environment to provide job, economic opportunities, social relations and urban quality.&lt;br /&gt;
The connection module is a common space where developing a weekly market and didactic or leisure activities (solarium, tai chi or whatever people and associations want to do). The greenhouse module can be an intensive production facility, the extension of bars and restaurants proposing self-grown vegetables, or a community garden. At last people can experience agriculture in their daily life!&lt;br /&gt;
JFB is composed by: 1)A buoyant structure floating over recycled empty drums. The greenhouse has been designed to be lightweight and as solid as a truss frame 2)The water management system produces fresh water through solar distillation at an amount suitable for growing crops within the greenhouse. We add a percentage of seawater, rich in nutrients, to reduce the amount of salts to be added. Also, JFB cools its internal environment exchanging heat with the waterbody and gets warm using wastewater from the distillation unit. 3)PV panels guarantee the small amount of electricity needed for pumps and fans. The systems are automated and remotely controlled to increase the ease of use. We collect data from our installations to predict the future behaviour of the system in different environments and to guarantee its replicability and adaptability to different conditions elsewhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
