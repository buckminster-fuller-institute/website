    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Thinkplace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; based in Australia; implementation in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; We worked in Kampala during an early Ebola outbreak. We saw first hand the devastating consequences and need for a more cohesive, informed response plus collective innovation. This motivated us to develop a system intervention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Our initiative will use networks and communities of interest to build awareness, and find opportunities (e.g. outbreak responses) for impactful participation. This will establish new pathways for actions and insight across the disease eco-system that previously has not existed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Youth Leading The World&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; YLTW is spinning an interconnected global web of change-makers, tackling wicked challenges together, through deep-listening, VIBRANT-GOALS, social-innovation and community-driven-change. YLTW empowers-repowers youth and communities to create deep-change-fast. By training local people, YLTW has scaled ten-fold, minimised costs and carbon footprint. Real-time-live-online facilitator training makes YLTW accessible even to remote communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;We are living beyond the Earth&#039;s regenerative capacity.&lt;br /&gt;
 Local and global eco-systems in critical decline.&lt;br /&gt;
 Economic and governance systems focus on continued growth on a finite planet, fuelled by massive debt (social, economic, personal, ecosystem)&lt;br /&gt;
 Consumption and &quot;&quot;having more stuff&quot;&quot; is sold as happiness.&lt;br /&gt;
 Massive inequity and poverty within and between nations.&lt;br /&gt;
 Urgency - short time to design new systems, create deep change.&lt;br /&gt;
 Positive change stories are not easily accessible.&lt;br /&gt;
 People overwhelmed by scale of challenges leading to inaction &amp;amp; withdrawal.&lt;br /&gt;
 Education systems failing to:&lt;br /&gt;
 # teach holistic thinking .&lt;br /&gt;
 # build understanding of complex, interconnected challenges.&lt;br /&gt;
 Misinformation promoted by vested-interests and climate-deniers.&lt;br /&gt;
 Political systems corrupted by influence of industrial-growth-system.&lt;br /&gt;
 Youth disengaged, overwhelmed, increasing despair.&lt;br /&gt;
 Youth change-makers often isolated, lack access to positive role-models and support systems to avoid burn out.&lt;br /&gt;
 Youth need skills for ongoing innovation.&lt;br /&gt;
 Need for trusted sources of current scientific information.&lt;br /&gt;
 Youth can&#039;t see how they can make a difference, lack confidence to create positive-change.&lt;br /&gt;
 Youth are effective change-makers and educators-influencers of adults, but struggle to be heard.&lt;br /&gt;
 Engagement programs can lead youth to believe they cannot create change as they are &quot;&quot;leaders of tomorrow&quot;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
 Society tends to fight the old world rather than create the new.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;YLTW is spinning an interconnected global web of change-makers, tackling the sustainability crisis together, through vision, innovation and community driven change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; By training and supporting people to run YLTW in their own region, OzGREEN&#039;s proven deep-change-fast process has scaled ten fold, whilst minimising costs and carbon footprint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Options for face-to-face and real-time-live-online facilitator training have made the initiative accessible even to remote communities. By training and supporting local people, YLTW becomes locally owned, driven and sustainable in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; YLTW begins with an annual 3-day youth eco-leadership congress conducted in multiple locations connected by digital media. YLTW enables youth to design their own pathways to fairer futures:&lt;br /&gt;
 INFORM: local and global sustainability challenges and one planet living;&lt;br /&gt;
 INNOVATE: action planning for personal and community change;&lt;br /&gt;
 INVOLVE: connecting change-makers locally and globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On day 3 youth run a Community Forum for local leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ultimately YLTW enables youth to become serial innovators and influencers, and is building a self-organising system of distributed leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Local-regional-global support circles foster collaboration and action. Achievements are recognised, success stories and challenges shared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In the past year YLTW partners and participants have received significant awards. At the start of 2015, YLTW is poised for scale.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Green World Game</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/green-world-game</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME&lt;/strong&gt;: Instituto Terra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; We are committed to engage a new generation of environmental champions, harnessing children&#039;s potential to be the agents of transition to a low-carbon economy. By reconnecting with nature and connecting with each other, we will foster a sense of community where each individual action will make a lasting difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Habitat and biodiversity loss due to deforestation has been the most significant environmental change resulting from human footprint on the planet. The challenges posed by global warming make forest restoration not just a question of governmental responsibility, but a necessary active pursuit of all citizens. Yet, there is a disconnect between the various spheres of action, and a lack of understanding of our responsibility as individuals, contributing to a sense of disempowerment and political inaction. Today, one of the greatest challenges is to create bridges among all stakeholders in order to forge cooperation and joint action. It is a call for “the human ability not just to act but to act in concert&quot; (Arendt,1970:143) as a necessary condition for bringing about real change in current state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a program of forest restoration with an important environmental education component. The program offers a package of creative solutions for engaging children in tree-planting actions and learning about the biodiversity of the Atlantic forest. The foundation of the project lies in the creation of a seed bank based in the partner institutions&#039; seedling production centres, representing a wide range of indigenous tree species. Tree-planting kits will be provided to elementary and middle school students (8-14 years old). These kits include seeds and collectable stickers of plant species. Workshops and field visits will stimulate children to grow and plant the seedlings, maintaining the plants until each reaches maturity (approximately six months).Location coordinates of the plants will be set in an open-source GIS platform integrated with Google Earth. This platform operates as an interface for tracking progress and knowledge sharing. Input and output data on forest restoration actions of each intervention area will be facilitated by an app easily accessible using &quot;Code&quot; technology through mobile devices. Community at large will be involved by establishing partnerships with local institutions for reaching the entire student population of each pilot project, and attracting businesses in exchange for carbon offsetting gains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>G-pod</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/g-pod</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; SPARK Architects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Australia, China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; G-Pod is a building system, with each individual pod&#039;s being capable of functioning autonomously or able to be interlinked with others to form more consolidated structures. G-pods, in both single and multi pod configurations, are readily deployable and can be easily dismantled, restructured, reused and re-located with minimal environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Our “business as normal&quot;&quot; approach to the construction of the built environment (our habitat) is incredibly energy hungry, environmentally destructive, inflexible - generally singular in function and, with respect to the life expectancy of modern buildings, significantly wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Humanity needs to embrace and evolve new ways of providing habitat for our species that ultimately works in harmony with the natural world, and this need is real and urgent. Climate Change and the undeniable degradation of our natural environment is most certainly the catalyst for such an approach. It is also, arguably, related to the planet experiencing an increase in extreme weather events and the resulting humanitarian disasters. Increases in refugee movement as a consequence of disaster, warfare and viruses such as Ebola has resulted in unprecedented demands on global aid and humanitarian organisations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Within the pursuit of a more holistic approach to the construction of our built environment is also the critical need for a system of rapidly deployable, autonomous buildings to serve humanitarian and post catastrophe needs. Buildings that are robust, flexible in use and scalable for specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; G-pod is a “system within a system&quot; and is intrinsically capable of providing “solutions within solutions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;G-Pod is a globally transportable, rapidly deployable building solution based on the structural and dimensional tolerances of ISO shipping containers. Through a series of mechanical (manual or automated) moves G-pods expand up to three times their original footprint and through the &#039;in pod&#039; incorporation of auxiliary elements provide a high level of amenity for all climate types. G-pods have the ability to generate and store their own electricity, collect and store their own rain water and treat waste water. The G-pod system allows for individual, stand alone pods, or the networking and consolidation of several or many pods into larger buildings and even tower structures.&lt;br /&gt;
 The G-Pod building system, can evolve, contract or expand to specific needs, both temporary and permanent. Pods can be added or subtracted as user needs change and entire configurations can be easily relocated to another site or whole or part can be re-purposed for other needs and or locations. The system allows our built environment to behave in a more organic manner with respect to the needs of the individual, and the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G-pods will be manufactured in Guangzhao China and can be sited anywhere in the world that you can position a shipping container.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>MASS Design Lab</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2013/mass-design-lab</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; MASS Design Lab is a research project of MASS Design Group, exploring the integration of public health, economic development, environmental performance and education into a comprehensive formalized architectural strategy through a rigorous assessment process and immersive community component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Design and public health operate in near-isolation and yet the consequences of both are inextricably linked. In 2010, over 250,000 people in Haiti were killed when one earthquake leveled buildings and devastated infrastructure. Three years later, Port-au-Prince remains vulnerable to disease as a result of a failed built environment. In Rwanda, the built environment contributes to high infant mortality rates and hospitals that spread disease. This toll is not unique to the developing world. The American Medical Association estimates that 80,000 people die annually due to hospital acquired infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating health considerations with building design is critical to resolving these devastating societal issues, but the research and social capital required is fiscally unachievable using current modes of practice. Buildings in the developing world are largely designed in isolation from the communities they serve. Often, local construction processes and materials are ignored and replaced by building systems with little cultural or economic relevance, perpetuating a systematic reliance on aid. MDLab develops a better built environment by implementing a practice based on investment in anticipatory social capacity that performs under crisis and change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Since 2008, MASS has developed significant immersive expertise through the design and construction of buildings, products, and policy in 7 countries. MASS has realized that architectural design in isolation cannot foster systematic improvement without an investment in research and training. MDLab embodies a practice that, through the development and dissemination of knowledge, leverages the potential of design to enable social innovation to respond to today’s greatest challenges.                     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, MDLab has identified four initiatives to be pursued during a three-year development phase:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Quantitative building assessment in the context of health, environment, and economy;&lt;br /&gt;
2) Development of policy initiatives for improved guidelines for safer buildings that exhibit better performance;&lt;br /&gt;
3) Use of local materials and innovative building technologies;&lt;br /&gt;
4) Dissemination of new knowledge through advocacy and education.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on knowledge gained through systematic research, MDLab conducts training programs to build internal capacity within MASS as well as expand the possibility of economic and social development through field workshops to engage communities and foster academic partnerships globally. Initially, research/training centers will be established in Rwanda and Haiti to begin prototyping processes for global application. For example, in Butaro, Rwanda a rural housing initiative has been launched as a communal effort, serving immediate needs and fostering growth through skill building in safe construction practices. This housing initiative creates means for collaborative exchange between local workers, students from the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), and universities worldwide. The research – training – design – construction workflow will link social and health outcomes with design, and generate a replicable feedback loop for global change. Additionally, the research conducted at the Butaro-based building lab will serve as small-scale tests for building technologies that can be translated to large-scale infrastructural buildings throughout Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Loowatt System</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2013/loowatt-system</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Loowatt System, a self-contained human waste collection and processing system that, rather than being faced with the typical costs of centralized sewage treatment systems, creatively converts human waste into energy and fertilizer, improving local health conditions, while providing economic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; 2.5 billion people today need access to safe sanitation, and resulting waterborne illnesses ravage productivity, causing disease and death. Loowatt has developed and implemented a waterless toilet system that offers a clean and odor free user experience, and produces energy and fertilizer, commodities which directly benefit toilet users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The Loowatt toilet seals human waste into biodegradable polymer film for anaerobic digestion (AD). AD converts the waste and film into biogas, used directly as fuel or converted to electricity, and digestate, a nutrient-rich liquid that is further treated and sold as fertilizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loowatt’s integrated approach creates a closed-loop value chain: toilet experience, AD performance optimization, energy generation, and fertilizer production. After years of practical experience testing product and system components at our London offices and laboratories, we have built a fully operational pilot in Antananarivo, Madagascar that successfully completes each link in the chain and has been serving customers since November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in many African capitals, 75% of Antananarivo city residents use dry pit latrines, while the entire urban area is without any formal disposal system for fecal sludge. 98% of latrines are emptied by private service providers with no regulation as to where sludge is discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loowatt also has great potential in countries that rely on unsustainable waterborne sewerage—markets we plan to enter in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Portable Light Project</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2012/portable-light-project</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Portable Light provides adaptable solar textile kits that enable the world’s poorest people to sew and weave bags, clothing and blankets that harvest energy. Portable Light strengthens local craft cultures to create diverse energy-producing communities with access to mobile networks that are transforming global health care, education and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; One-quarter of the world lives without electricity. Glass solar panels are breakable, costly to produce and transport. It takes over two years of use to recover the embodied energy/carbon emissions in glass panels— Earth can’t afford this. Portable Light rethinks the material, form and delivery of clean energy and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Portable Light is a non-profit initiative with an international team of NGO’s, community leaders, anthropologists, doctors, architects and engineers. Portable Light Pilot Projects have been serving communities in Mexico since 2005, with projects now underway in Nicaragua, Haiti, Brazil, South Africa and Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our low carbon solar textile kits are inspired from firefly bioluminescence and based on principles of simplicity, adaptability and mobile ‘on demand’ energy and light. We ask: how are the greatest human benefits gained from the smallest, most useful amounts of clean energy? The Portable Light Kit is an affordable 2 watt flexible thin film, a control tray with rechargeable battery and USB port,an LED light, and a textile reflector. About 8 hours of sunlight fully charges the battery, which powers LED light and USB enabled tools, such as medical devices, radios, and cell phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to charge a cell phone enables people to bridge distances and benefit from connectivity to mobile SMS technologies that are transforming the organization and delivery of health care, business and education in the developing world. At night, renewable white light for reading, tasks and room illumination extends time in the evening, creating unprecedented opportunities for study and work at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our vision is to build human capacity by integrating clean energy and lighting with the vast, globally diverse knowledge base of textile production. We provide rugged, 12 ounce solar textile kits and training to communities, engaging the community’s rich knowledge of textile skills, and familiarity with textiles as a part of everyday life. This culturally integrated approach facilitates technology adoption, ownership and stewardship among vulnerable women and families and is fundamentally distinct from smokestack mass-production, which homogenizes cultures with a singular product ‘form’. Every PL Flex kit design has a unique beauty that comes from its maker.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>International Indigenous Design Charter</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2017/international-indigenous-design-charter</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The primary aim of this policy/systems design project is to develop an International Indigenous Design Charter. Its mission is to guide designers (indigenous and non-indigenes) on the appropriate use of Indigenous knowledge and culture in communication design and associated areas of design practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Increasingly Indigenous culture is being identified by design firms and branding agencies as providing a unique point of difference, especially in the representation of location in place branding. As designers become more aware of both their professional and moral responsibilities they need to understand the power they have to influence opinions. This initiative aims to address the issue of cultural appropriation and the inappropriate referencing and representation of Indigenous peoples in design practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The International Indigenous Design Charter will be a best practice policy guide for the communication design profession and associated disciplines including graphic design, digital design, environmental design, branding, advertising and design strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Charter will suggest that designers need to understand the co-creation concept of relationality and that in some cases co-authors are better described as co-beneficiaries. The Charter recommend that when working on projects involving the representation of Indigenous/First Nation culture communication designers and buyers of design (non-Indigenous and Indigenous) are expected to adhere to the following ten points (draft):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Indigenous led&lt;br /&gt;
2) Self-determined&lt;br /&gt;
3) Community specific&lt;br /&gt;
4) Deep listening&lt;br /&gt;
5) Impact of design&lt;br /&gt;
6) Indigenous knowledge&lt;br /&gt;
7) Shared knowledge/Indigenous knowledge (collaboration, co-creation, procurement)&lt;br /&gt;
8) Legal and moral&lt;br /&gt;
9) Cultural competency&lt;br /&gt;
10) Charter implementation&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONTACT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
