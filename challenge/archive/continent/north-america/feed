    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Sensitile Systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Michigan, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; POWERleap has developed a means to generate 100% renewable energy with nothing more than human footsteps. Our solution is a flooring system that uses piezoelectric technology to convert kinetic energy from people into electricity. Current tests show that 1 kwh of energy can be generated from a 50 m2 area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; A series of custom Terrazzo Lumina™ tiles were designed and created for designer and inventor, Elizabeth Redmond to help her demonstrate her POWERleap concept, which harnesses the energy in human footsteps to illuminate the floor. The tiles were provided with recesses for Piezo-electric transducers that capture the vibration from movement and convert it into a burst of LED light which is expressed into the surface of the tiles.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Clean Energy Moonshot</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/clean-energy-moonshot</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; World Business Academy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Santa Barbara, California, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Clean Energy Moonshot is a new system for renewable energy production, management, and distribution that disrupts centralized monopolies by empowering communities to create their own energy. It addresses the need for a rapidly scalable implementation of renewable energy - a critical but currently unavailable component of the fight against climate catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Humanity must transition off of fossil fuels as soon as possible. To accomplish this, we must create a new system for the creation of energy to power our lives. In order to transition rapidly, this new system must be scalable, efficient, and flexibleŠ—”in other words, it should be a disruptive force that can out-compete the existing model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The technology to replace the fossil fuel economy with 100-percent renewable energy exists today. The missing link is a system that is reliable, resilient, financeable, and empowering for communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 1. Reliability: The new system must meet the modern need for energy (electricity as well as transportation and heating fuels).&lt;br /&gt;
 2. Resilience: The new system must withstand unprecedented storms, fires, flooding, and winds resulting from worsening environmental factors.&lt;br /&gt;
 3. Financing: The new system will require unprecedented investment. In order to rapidly scale, the new system must include attractive investment opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;
 4. Community Empowerment: As a top priority, the new system must benefit local communities. It must make regional economies stronger, air cleaner, and neighborhoods safer. It must go further, inspiring and incentivizing individuals to reduce their personal impact and to take responsibility for building a regenerative civilization.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;What? A localized but highly scalable system for the production, distribution, and storage of 100-percent renewable electricity provides all the power needed in a given region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Where? The launchpad begins in southern Santa Barbara County, California - a community at risk of catastrophic blackouts because of crumbling electricity transmission infrastructure. Santa Barbara is forward thinking, environmentally aware, and possesses influence to initiate and build a new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; How? A regional public education campaign leverages the highly educated and motivated population; developing the political will for replacing the crumbling, dirty energy system with a robust and modern renewable energy system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A Community Microgrid electricity system is designed and built, linking solar panels, wind turbines, fuel cells, and other proven distributed energy generation systems together using existing wires with some upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Local energy management and advanced software systems allow innovation in the pricing of energy. Local markets and incentives drive the mass deployment of local renewable energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Energy created and managed where utilized provides maximum efficiency. Excess renewable energy charges electric cars and is stored as hydrogen for later use in fuel cells and vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Demonstrated success spreads the meme, California&#039;s energy system becomes an interconnected network of Community Microgrids.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Urbinsight: The EcoCitizen World Map Project</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/urbinsight-ecocitizen-world-map-project</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Ecocity Builders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Oakland, California, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Urbinsight project connects communities with web-based mapping tools designed to explore and measure holistic urban health from a citizens&#039; perspective. Based on a bottom-up approach to documenting environmental conditions at the neighborhood scale, the project provides tools, training, and knowledge for creating more sustainable, resilient urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Cities play a critical role in the quest for solutions to global environmental challenges. Recent decades have witnessed an increasing trend of concentration of the world&#039;s population in urban areas — by 2050 it is estimated that two-thirds of the world&#039;s population will live in cities. Urban areas currently account for 60% to 80% of the world&#039;s greenhouse gas emissions, and the numbers are similar for demand for water and energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; An important step in the process of addressing these challenges and creating effective solutions is the ability to understand, measure and quantify the environmental impacts of cities, in terms of consumption of energy and natural resources and generation of waste. There is a need for detailed, accurate data and information about local urban environmental conditions, as well as social and economic conditions that affect both the immediate quality of life for residents and the long-term resilience and sustainability of urban areas. Furthermore, access to such data and information is a key consideration, both for citizens (so that they can be involved in governance and action to improve environmental conditions and quality of life) and for local governments (in order to support good public policy, decision making and urban management).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Urbinsight uses GIS and online multimedia applications to graphically and spatially display information about the state of the urban ecosystem. The project is implemented in each pilot city through collaboration with local universities, community-based organizations, and government agencies. The key goals are to actively engage citizens in learning, planning, and advocating for their communities; and to provide original neighborhood-level data to complement official government data that can inform policy and decision-making for more sustainable cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urbinsight incorporates an educational component based on the &quot;EcoCompass&quot; curriculum, which includes participatory action research methods and learning forums. It also utilizes a methodology known as urban metabolism modeling, which measures the &quot;source to sink&quot; flows of resources, including water, energy and solid waste, as they move through the built environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial phase includes the creation of a base map that displays key features of the natural and built environment, as well as several urban environmental indicators (these initial data to be mapped are obtained from open government data sources). After taking part in workshops on participatory information technologies, citizens can then contribute community-generated data and upload their observations and reports about neighborhood conditions to the map via mobile phones or the web.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>The Global Futures Intelligence System</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/global-futures-intelligence-system</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; The Millennium Project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Washington D.C., USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; A new collective intelligence system for humanity to think together about the future in a holistic, synergistic, systematic, organized on-line platform, that helps manage the knowledge explosion and allows feedback on strategies, priorities, insights, methods, and research on 15 global challenges, focusing on the signals not trivia and info overload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Society - locally and globally - is too fragmented, polarized, and uninformed about our global situation and prospects for the future to work in a more coherent, synergistic, loving way. We need a way to see the integrated big picture backed-up by continually updated data, research, and informed judgments that allows for a range of views on insights and strategies. GFIS is a new way to integrate ideas, programs, research, news, models, and data on a global and local basis to help people create more integrated strategy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The Global Futures Intelligence System (GFIS) is a unique software system that resides in the Amazon Cloud (hence, we can scale up fast without notice). The system is custom built and hosted on Amazon EC2 Ubuntu instances. The JavaScript is not just front-end, the backend is built with Node.JS. Much work has been done on system stability; system load speed; security; and mobile capabilities. We have also programmed the system on which that code runs. Each of 15 Global Challenges has the same 11 item menu: RSS news feed aggregater, annotated scanning items promoted from news items or added by bookmarklets and reviewers and staff, situation chart (current situation, desired situation, policies to address the gap), report (overview and long text, data, charts), web resources, books, papers, questions, comments, data sets (not yet implemented), models, dashboard/digest, and edit history. People around the world can comment on any piece of information, suggest edits, and through a quick review process can change any part of the system. Our 55 Node chairs around the world will be trained in how to introduce it in their countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Soft Systems, High Grounds</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/soft-systems-high-grounds</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; MIT Urban Risk Lab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Haiti&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; This project involves a prototypical system of disaster evacuation parks across the Caribbean country of Haiti for more than 5,000 sites of schools and markets as protective and preemptive economic infrastructures for disaster risk reduction and economic recovery against the dangers of hurricanes, severe floods, mudslides, and earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Against extreme economic and ecologic dynamics of tropical urban life in Haiti, this project proposes open spaces distributed across extreme topographies and dynamic watersheds designed to address five challenging complexities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Extreme Terrain: 80% of land in Haiti privately owned, and over 50% of the population lives in highly mountainous, poorly accessible areas, or downstream, in fertile yet floodable valley regions. Populations are unevenly distributed across a range of densities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Construction Capacity: Up until 2010, Haiti did not have a national building code. Interventions must be simple, minimal, and scalable for training and new trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Purchasing Power: the average Haitian income is between 2$ and 3$ per day. Interventions must capitalize on people&#039;s livelihoods within construction techniques that are commensurate with cultures of maintenance to avoid inequity and strife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Literacy and Legibility: nearly 50% of the population over 25 years old cannot read or write. Interventions must be easily legible, simple to understand, with highly graphic and visual methods referencing creole culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Youth Work Force: since more than 50% of the population is below 25 years old, interventions must work with youth organizations to develop and cultivate their potential through better access to education, training, and job markets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The project is based in the intensely agricultural and urban region of the Artibonite River Valley of Haiti, a major agronomic area where more than 1 million people live. Using 9 prototypical sites at 9 different elevations with 9 different population densities, the range of prototypical evacuation parks range from the coastal level at 0.00m asl, to high altitude mountain ranges at 3,000m asl. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Associated with markets and schools in the river valley, a preliminary set of disaster evacuation parks are thus proposed to be developed as protective spaces against the threat of hurricanes, floods, and mudslides during the rainy season, while provide a buffer against drought and low water season. Through the synthetic design of ground access and accessibility, micro-elements such as lighting, pathways, and topography are combined with micro-infrastructures of plants and vegetation using local, construction techniques and creole craft to form dual purpose spaces for economic functions and ecologic services that grow over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; From coast to mountain, city to countryside, the project aims to be applied in areas across 5 major watersheds and river basins of the country with a population totaling 9 million people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/vertical-axis-wind-turbine</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; P+ Studio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The strategy is a patented innovation (Patent Registration Nr. US8.282.236B2) for the optimized operation of Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT) that can be utilized in multiple scales to achieve an Energy-Plus balance in products and buildings, as illustrated in two projects: the Self Sustaining Street Light and Turbine-House&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Wind power generation is on the verge of reaching a peak level of importance as a clean, renewable energy source. In the US, wind energy electricity generation increased by 20% in 2013 [National Renewable Energy Lab]. However, the total worldwide installed wind capacity by mid-2014 will still only generate around 4% of the world&#039;s electricity demand. [Source: World Wind Energy Association, Half-Yearly Report 2014]. In addition, fossil fuels still make up approximately 80% of global energy consumption [World Energy Council, 2013]. The result of which has led to an increase in global CO2 levels, climate change, and pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In response to these ongoing energy challenges, wind-powered street furniture and housing have very little impact on the environment through their use of renewable energy sources and due to the fact that they virtually eliminate the need for trench work and cabling. In fact, with the patented augmented geometry of the VAWT case work, the House and Street Light can create an energy surplus. The holistic strategy of integrating efficient wind turbines into multiple urban and product scales has the capacity to allow for off-the-grid energy plus living, reducing the need for fossil fuels while helping to maintain an emission-free environment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;This fully integrated solution balances energy efficient components for reduced consumption with maximised energy generation and significantly improves upon existing designs. VAWT provides the ability for wind energy harnessing from any wind direction, increased by the introduction of multiple, phase-offset rotor stages. The patented strategy enables amplification of wind velocities through a three-dimensional converging funnel section that increases energy output by over 250%. It raises the rotor power coefficient while providing low cut-in wind speed and start-up requirements for efficient and extended operational hours. This strategy can be scaled for numerous applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The geometry is designed to house PV cells in addition to VAWT. Product and building applications can be installed virtually anywhere, provided that it is in a location that receives ample wind. Both devices are designed to be pre-fabricated and configurable to the site. In response to climate and location, the building envelope can be configured to either facilitate solar gain or to prevent the overheating of the interior. Similarly, both the Street Light and the House have a solar-facing PV top, specifically angled to maximise solar exposure for optimum energy generation. Numerous energy storage and hybrid building technologies have been designed to complement efficient operation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Roses in Concrete Community School</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/roses-concrete-community-school</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Oakland, California, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; End urban poverty through education by positioning school as the center of health in a community. Reverse the model of “out-migration&quot; of young talent by making investments in the most vulnerable urban youth and families, creating a return pathway for youth to return home to help make their communities thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;We are losing entire generations of urban youth who feel trapped in a cycle of poverty, violence, hopelessness and despair.&quot; Rather than continually investing in models that try to save the “deserving few&quot; who can escape from these communities, we propose a solution that allows the vast majority to overcome these toxic conditions and become the responsible and productive adults who will eliminate those conditions. By creating a sustainable community, centered around a school that gives students and families love, security, nourishment, care, and education, we offer a model of success and revitalization that reverses decades of disinvestment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The point of education is not to escape poverty - it is to end poverty. We can do this by cultivating urban youth who understand the importance of returning to vulnerable communities to invest and serve as community leaders. By partnering with community partners and institutions of higher learning that have traditionally worked in silos, we can collaborate synergistically to bust up the concrete. Instead of replicating models that pluck out the individual roses that manage to grow between the cracks in the concrete, our model breaks up the concrete so that entire rose gardens can blossom in our highest need neighborhoods.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Our K-8 charter/lab school pilot will serve 360 children from East Oakland, one of the nation&#039;s most impoverished communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; HOW: Based on Maslow&#039;s hierarchy of needs, our community-responsive model of urban education treats the school as a center of health in the community, prioritizing the most basic human needs before &#039;teaching.&#039; We collaborate with community partners, foundations and research universities to provide Resources, then Relationships, Relevancy, Rigor and Responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Our lab school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; - Develops robust partnerships with community partners, foundations and research universities to offer secure on-site access to food, clothing, shelter, physical and psychological safety, medical care, etc. for students and their families.&lt;br /&gt;
 - Offers culturally-responsive teaching practices, looping, critical pedagogy, differentiated instruction and transformative school leadership.&lt;br /&gt;
 - Provides a permanent source of multi-year apprenticeships to create a pipeline of exceptionally well-trained urban school administrators and teachers, with an emphasis on candidates of color.&lt;br /&gt;
 - Provides adult mentors/teachers who &quot;loop&quot; with the child through multiple grades to understand each child and family, and model living as Warrior-Scholars who are responsible to self, family, community and world. The goal is to cultivate a pipeline of youth that go away to college and come back to help our most vulnerable communities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Renewing America&#039;s Interstate Highway Corridor</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/renewing-americas-interstate-highway-corridor</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Whole Systems Design, LLC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Vermont, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The largest infrastructure project in American history - The Interstate Highway - is reinvented to become the backbone of an adaptive reuse strategy for the continent. 1,870,000 acres of mown land within the corridor is retrofitted using perennial crops and market-access to become a resource generator rather than a sink.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The United States Interstate Highway System is one of the nation&#039;s most valuable capital and cultural assets. Conceived during the era of inexpensive fossil fuels, the current system is ill-adapted to a renewable resource economy. The Highway is also placeless in a nation reclaiming local economies and identities. Highway corridors of the future must not only provide renewable mobility pathways but must themselves become productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The prevailing land management practice along the 1.87 million acres of intensely valuable land (accessible, low-angle, and visible) is mowing. A monoculture of landscape begets a monoculture of experience - the primary cultural encounter of the Interstate being one of anonymity, speed and mass-marketing. One of our largest national assets has become a cultural and economic sink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A Renewed Interstate Corridor based on regenerative, perennial agriculture will sequester carbon, bioremediate freshwater and increase ecological vitality. Biomass, solar, and wind power are produced and distributed while wildlife corridors are integrated to minimize fractured continental ecosystems. The interstate system would also provide resource distribution hubs and increase access to diversifying local markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It is time to renew America&#039;s interstate highways to be a national economic engine while serving as a primary network for continental resiliency.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Areas along I-89 in central Vermont will be identified and developed to produce biomass and other forms of renewable energy. These pilot projects will test feasibility, management strategies, design elements, strategic partnerships and other aspects needed to create a model that is effective, viable and scaleable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The steps needed to do this include building collaboration among stakeholders through a shared vision; identification of most optimal areas; site design; project implementation; management/monitoring, and utilization of resources generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Pilot projects will begin with the most easily implemented aspects of the proposal since investment and infrastructure redevelopment only occurs when models prove viable. Aspects of the proposal such as redeveloped rest areas and integrated wildlife corridors will be conceptualized but likely not developed until later phases. Renewing the Interstate would begin first by the lowest hanging fruit - making the acreage itself more compelling and productive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Management and data collection would be facilitated through a combination of State and University partners wherein student research and other academic projects utilize the pilot projects as field labs in the areas of community development, transportation, and renewable energy systems. Other innovative models established in Vermont over the past several decades have proven effective using this strategy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Arctic Food Network</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2012/arctic-food-network</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Lateral Office&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Nunavut, Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Arctic Food Network is a series of strategically distributed shelters in Baffin Island, Nunavut (Canada). The network addresses food security, biological and wildlife species management, and provides a safe navigation system across the region. AFN is developed in partnership with the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth in Nunavut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; In the 2006 Census, Canada’s three northern territories—Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut—posted a combined population of over 100,000 people for the first time in Canadian history with the territory of Nunavut significantly exceeding Canada’s average population growth rate. Approximately 33,000 people (84% Inuit) live dispersed across 23 communities in Nunavut. Populations in the Canadian North are remarkably young; almost a third of the population is under the age of 15, and the average is 25 years of age. The challenges facing circumpolar peoples are urgent and requires fresh thinking with a strong understanding of traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this urgency to expand to accommodate population growth, there is little vision of how to grow beyond economic expediency and efficiency. Historically, the Inuit have had southern models foisted upon them – be it food, housing or education. Some of the greatest challenges facing northern communities are physical isolation, economic marginalization, youth disenfranchisement, and loss of traditional knowledge. The younger generations of Inuit find themselves caught between traditional and contemporary cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional Inuit diet, which is centered on hunting and fishing, has been slowly compromised by an influx of southern manufactured food products, leading to increased obesity and diabetes levels. The health impacts of this diet are amplified in the north, due to the high cost of shipping fresh produce and healthier, perishable goods to radically dispersed and remote northern communities. A typical food basket in Nunavut is twice the cost of the same food basket in southern Canada, while standards of living and salaries are often lower. The Arctic Food Network (AFN) addresses an urgent need for a snowmobile accessed regional network of arctic farms, freezers, and camp hubs. The AFN encircles the large body of the Foxe Basin in Nunavut, Canada, home to a richly diverse wildlife, along the coast of Baffin Island and some 30,000 Nunavummiut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The Arctic Food Network utilizes the existing skidoo trails, the only form of ground connection amongst the eleven disconnected Inuit communities of Baffin Island. The project proposes to address the threats of health, poverty, and loss of culture through the integration of communities with a unique infrastructure system. It is a 21st century arctic snow highway, with arctic rest-stop cabins. The AFN trail hubs re-enforce the use of the trails by strategically deploying a regional network of hunting cabins, arctic farms and camp hubs that encircle Foxe Basin and acknowledge the Inuit tradition of temporary enclosure in a cold climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AFN is a new model for cold climate survival that would assist to sustain the rapidly increasing (youthful) populations in northern settlements, but also potentially offer a future exportable economy for the North. Each of the hubs along the AFN opportunistically negotiates its local ecosystems, emergent biological potentials, and its proximity to communities. AFN hubs are distributed at 160km intervals. Hubs occupy varied sites: land, water/ice, or coastal conditions. Each of these sitings offers a specific harvestable food product.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; New York City, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Lowline is a plan to use innovative solar technology to illuminate an historic trolley terminal on the Lower East Side of New York City. Our vision is a stunning underground park, providing a beautiful respite and a cultural attraction in one of the world’s most dense, exciting urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; The proposed location is the one-acre former Williamsburg Bridge Trolley Terminal, just below Delancey Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The site was opened in 1908 for trolley passengers, but has been unused since 1948 when trolley service was discontinued. Despite six decades of neglect, the space still retains some incredible features, like remnant cobblestones, crisscrossing rail tracks and vaulted ceilings. It is also directly adjacent to the existing JMZ subway track at the Essex Street subway stop– so park visitors and subway riders would interact daily. This hidden historic site is located in one of the least green areas of New York City— presenting a unique opportunity to reclaim unused space for public good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Designed by James Ramsey of Raad Studio, the proposed solar technology involves the creation of a “remote skylight.” In this approach, sunlight passes through a glass shield above the parabolic collector, and is reflected and gathered at one focal point, and directed underground. Sunlight is transmitted onto a reflective surface on the distributor dish underground, transmitting that sunlight into the space. This technology would transmit the necessary wavelengths of light to support photosynthesis, enabling plants and trees to grow. During periods of sunlight, electricity would not be necessary to light the space. In September 2012, the Lowline team built a full scale prototype of the technology in an abandoned warehouse in the Lower East Side, for the “Imagining the Lowline” exhibit. The exhibit attracted thousands of visitors, was heavily covered by the press and ultimately served as a proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
