    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Thinkplace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; based in Australia; implementation in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; We worked in Kampala during an early Ebola outbreak. We saw first hand the devastating consequences and need for a more cohesive, informed response plus collective innovation. This motivated us to develop a system intervention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Our initiative will use networks and communities of interest to build awareness, and find opportunities (e.g. outbreak responses) for impactful participation. This will establish new pathways for actions and insight across the disease eco-system that previously has not existed.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Urbinsight: The EcoCitizen World Map Project</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/urbinsight-ecocitizen-world-map-project</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Ecocity Builders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Oakland, California, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Urbinsight project connects communities with web-based mapping tools designed to explore and measure holistic urban health from a citizens&#039; perspective. Based on a bottom-up approach to documenting environmental conditions at the neighborhood scale, the project provides tools, training, and knowledge for creating more sustainable, resilient urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Cities play a critical role in the quest for solutions to global environmental challenges. Recent decades have witnessed an increasing trend of concentration of the world&#039;s population in urban areas — by 2050 it is estimated that two-thirds of the world&#039;s population will live in cities. Urban areas currently account for 60% to 80% of the world&#039;s greenhouse gas emissions, and the numbers are similar for demand for water and energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; An important step in the process of addressing these challenges and creating effective solutions is the ability to understand, measure and quantify the environmental impacts of cities, in terms of consumption of energy and natural resources and generation of waste. There is a need for detailed, accurate data and information about local urban environmental conditions, as well as social and economic conditions that affect both the immediate quality of life for residents and the long-term resilience and sustainability of urban areas. Furthermore, access to such data and information is a key consideration, both for citizens (so that they can be involved in governance and action to improve environmental conditions and quality of life) and for local governments (in order to support good public policy, decision making and urban management).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Urbinsight uses GIS and online multimedia applications to graphically and spatially display information about the state of the urban ecosystem. The project is implemented in each pilot city through collaboration with local universities, community-based organizations, and government agencies. The key goals are to actively engage citizens in learning, planning, and advocating for their communities; and to provide original neighborhood-level data to complement official government data that can inform policy and decision-making for more sustainable cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urbinsight incorporates an educational component based on the &quot;EcoCompass&quot; curriculum, which includes participatory action research methods and learning forums. It also utilizes a methodology known as urban metabolism modeling, which measures the &quot;source to sink&quot; flows of resources, including water, energy and solid waste, as they move through the built environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial phase includes the creation of a base map that displays key features of the natural and built environment, as well as several urban environmental indicators (these initial data to be mapped are obtained from open government data sources). After taking part in workshops on participatory information technologies, citizens can then contribute community-generated data and upload their observations and reports about neighborhood conditions to the map via mobile phones or the web.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>GravityLight</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/gravitylight</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Over 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity and millions more have unreliable supply. Instead they rely on dangerous, polluting and expensive kerosene lamps for light. GravityLight transforms the pull of gravity into electricity. It&#039;s a unique solution designed as an affordable, safe and reliable alternative.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;A typical kerosene lamp resembles a Molotov cocktail - a bottle or tin can, fuel and wick. It&#039;s an extremely dangerous and polluting combination that consumes 20% of a family&#039;s income, ongoing, locking them into a cycle of energy poverty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Kerosene lamps are also a significant cause of health issues and burns: the WHO equates these fumes to smoking 40 cigarettes a day and, in India alone, 1.5 million people suffer burns due to overturned kerosene lamps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Furthermore, kerosene lamps are responsible for 3% of global CO2 emissions and emit significant amounts of black carbon, equivalent to a quarter of global diesel emissions, annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; GravityLight is a low-cost, safe, clean and reliable alternative. GravityLight pays for itself within 3 months of switching from kerosene and saves families money thereafter. Children have more, healthier light to study by and parents to work by, in turn increasing educational attainment and earnings whilst reducing smoke related illnesses. All this leads to increased disposable income and empowers families to break free from a cycle of energy poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The majority of off-grid households are based in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where The GravityLight Foundation is partnering with local organisations to reach the largest number possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;GravityLight is an innovative approach to off-grid power that creates a new category of off-grid lighting. It takes seconds to lift a weight that provides 25 minutes of light on its descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; GravityLight can be used anytime, repeatedly. With no need for batteries or the sun, it is unique in that it can be stored indefinitely and used in any country, whatever the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; GravityLight has been designed with off-grid households, typically living on $2.50 /day in mind. As such, all unnecessary costs have been ruthlessly designed out, whilst balancing the need for an elegant yet robust product used in a range of different situations and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A global field trial among off-grid households in 26 different countries was conducted to test the concept, demand and feasibility of GravityLight. Over 90% of triallists said they would use one instead of a kerosene lamp and also provided invaluable feedback which has been integrated into an improved version due to be launched this Autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; To establish a sustainable model, GravityLights will be sold through local distribution networks making a living from selling GravityLights and similar clean energy products, throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; moWoza is an supply chain and money management solution for grassroots SMEs and low income communities in emerging markets that can be accessed via the mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re addressing poverty reduction (MDG 1), food security and ensuring that female informal micro &amp;amp; cross-border traders (SMMEs) are empowered (MDG 3) and become financially included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Sub Saharan Africa (SSA), the informal sector is almost equivalent to the formal sector, representing an average 43% of official GDP in 2003.  This is also of significance in Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe (OECD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Cereal consumption is growing throughout SSA at an average rate of 2% and as income levels increase in SSA, demand for processed agricultural food will increase (UNDP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mechanism needs to be in place to leapfrog traditional supply chain system so that SMMEs can easily access non-perishable foodstuffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many SMMEs are travelling long distances across borders, carrying large amounts of cash on their bodies to access goods.  They find themselves in dangerous situations and lose both money and inventory.  On a package of $100, crossborder SMMEs can pay an extra:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50% on journeys to neighbour countries, 116% for accommodation whilst travelling, 20% on bribes and suffer from stigma/violence.  They lose sales as they travel so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- To date cross-border SMMEs buy stock individually and in minimal quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Our mobile solution enables crossborder SMMEs in Mozambique to order basic essential products remotely at competitive prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through an inclusive business model we facilitate entrepreneurial activity at the BOP. Our solution delivers trade efficiencies, creates opportunities, protects women and delivers positive climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer an inventory ordering and delivery service for four categories of basic 10 essential food products and 5 hygenic products. Crossborder SMMEs can order these products at affordable prices from any location via SMS. They can pay utilising a mobile wallet or our own SMS mobile payment system. We deliver within 3-days and on delivery the Crossborder SMMEs pays the balance and the taxi driver receives a handling fee.  Crossborder SMMEs are kept updated of delivery status via SMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aggregate the orders so that they can access bulk prices and more quality products. Our virtual mobile phone co-operative platform allows Crossborder SMMEs to access inventory price related information; order and pre-pay inventory; receive delivery status notifications and will be able to access micro-loans via SMS, WEB and other innovative mobile wallet technologies on their mobile phone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work with community taxi drivers to deliver the products and keep them informed of deliveries via SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Israel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; We developed a children design-oriented affordable wheelchair for less developed environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 7 million disabled children lack wheelchairs and do not have access to education. Through our affordable $100 children wheelchairs we will empower access to primary education and to future independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Current solutions for children mobility are just a &quot;&quot;size reduction&quot;&quot; of an adults solution. Our children oriented design enhances the disabled child and improves his self esteem with his peers. The $100 wheelchair is supported by rehabilitation training teams where necessary providing a comprehensive and integral community rehabilitation solution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Liberia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Using solar cooling &amp;amp; freezing technologies, Emergi developed a solution to address the challenges in Liberia&#039;s energy sector, which is polluting, unreliable and expensive. Our strategy is to provide clean, reliable and affordable energy to increase agricultural production, people&#039;s livelihood, Liberia&#039;s socioeconomic development &amp;amp; food security and reduce environmental deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Liberia remains one of the poorest countries in the world, facing challenges of unemployment, food insecurity and malnutrition. Access to energy in Liberia is limited, with just 4.1% of the Liberian population having access (World Bank 2015). Most farmers have no access to storage facilities resulting in 50% of waste (FAO 2010). Those who have storage, mainly use diesel generators, which can cost up to $70 daily, contributing to CO2 emissions and polution. Poverty prevails with 84% of the population living under the poverty line (IMF 2012). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Our initiative addresses these challenges by offering solar cooling and freezing as affordable, reliable, clean energy to local communities and farmers to help tackle the challenges of food security, decrease waste and increase income. As a result, farmers will be able to maximise their agricultural potential and close farm-to-market gaps, create employment and reduce poverty. Additionally, our initiative contributes to global CO2 emission reduction. CO2 in the atmosphere increased by 35% since the beginning of industrialisation and is responsible for 63% of global warming (NOAA 2015). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The solar and freezing cooling technology can be used in a wide variety of countries facing similar challenges as Liberia, thereby contributing to the sustainable development goals.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Emergi, supported by focus group interviews held in Liberia, developed two solar cooling and freezing technologies, to store food, dehumidify to prevent decay, and make ice to transport marine and agricultural products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed two innovations using proven technologies. For cooling large volumes of air, evaporative cooling is highly suitable as it is cheap and reliable. For humid conditions, as found in Liberia, this can only work if the air is dried. Our system uses, Desiccant Enhanced Evaporative Air-Conditioning (DEVAP) with a liquid desiccant, which is dried using solar heat. The output is cool and dry air, both needed to store food in Liberia. For solar freezing we have developed a system and built a working prototype, that uses active carbon and methanol to produce ice after the air is dehumidified. This technology, called adsorption cooling, collects solar energy during day, and produces ice during night. See attachments for detailed explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Solar cooling is a solution for Liberia&#039;s challenges because it:&lt;br /&gt;
+ does not rely on limited resources.&lt;br /&gt;
+ can be combined with nearly all kinds of backup heat sources.&lt;br /&gt;
+ is applicable anywhere in West Africa.&lt;br /&gt;
+ prices are highly predictable and the running costs negligible.&lt;br /&gt;
+ has an extremely low environmental impact during its life cycle.&lt;br /&gt;
+ creates poverty reduction by creating new jobs in renewable energies.&lt;br /&gt;
+ when used at social institutions like hospitals will increase the hygienic situation and cut the  running costs.&lt;br /&gt;
+ benefits from the strong correlation between supply of the solar resource and energy demand for cooling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our strategy is to support local employment through local assembly and using local materials to maximize our socio-economic impact. Our business model is to offer communal warehouse facilities to local communities and small farmers, for a fee and sell the units with a loan instrument.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Affordable Passive House Prototype</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2014/affordable-passive-house-prototype</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The affordable Passive House Prototype (PHP) is a groundbreaking concept of affordable housing using renewable energy sources such as solar PV power, bio-gas from bio-digesters, harvested rainwater and bio-climatic design to achieve thermal cooling and natural ventilation. The buildings are constructed from locally available compressed earth blocks and bamboo components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, is the world’s eighth largest producer of oil. Paradoxically Nigeria is also a nation of widespread poverty, inadequate infrastructure and a huge housing deficit. With a teeming population of approximately 170 million, Nigeria currently generates 4,400 megawatts of electricity even though it currently needs 40,000!  Unreliable and epileptic power supply has plagued the country in the past 30 years, as the population growth has far outstripped the country’s power generation and distribution capacity. The Energy Commission of Nigeria states that 60 million Nigerians now own generators. Nigeria is the largest net importer of generators in the world, even though abundant sources of renewable energy exist. This prototype is designed for the millions of Nigerians who do not have access to affordable decent housing, reliable power supply, water or sanitation. Nigeria suffers poverty (70% below the poverty line), unemployment (21%), low Human Development Index (0.4), inadequate infrastructure, deforestation, desertification, unreliable power supply, rapid urbanization, substandard housing and a whopping 16 million-unit housing deficit. Residences account for 52% of energy demand. 80% of the population live in deplorable housing conditions where whole families often occupy one room with shared facilities.  This initiative addresses dignity, hope and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The Passive House Prototype is an affordable housing prototype that uses 50 - 75% less energy than a similar house in a similar location. Each building comprises four housing units designed around two courtyards. Each housing unit is made up of two rooms, a kitchen, a bathroom and a small circulation space linking the rooms. Each unit is provided with 160watts of solar power, using solar PV systems. Cooling and natural lighting is further achieved by large windows, cross ventilation, courtyards, wide overhangs, shading from trees and landscaping. Rainwater is harvested to and boreholes are sunk to make each building self-sufficient for water needs. Kitchen and toilet waste are recycled into a bio-digester (instead of a septic tank) to produce biogas (methane) for cooking. the houses have been constructed for $25 per square foot in Port Harcourt, south eastern Nigeria. They were constructed in 12 weeks, and each dwelling unit costs approximately $12,500 per family. Cost savings were achieved  using locally available compressed earth blocks. The buildings are cool, affordable and attractive. We believe that every human has the right to live in beauty and sustainability in a place that they can call their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (2017): Comprehensive Design Services (CDS) designs, engineers and builds affordable green housing known as Passive House Prototypes. These homes are self-cooling, solar-powered and water-sufficient. The self-cooling occurs because the building design is dictated by the climate. Water, from beneath the feet of the occupants, is pumped up from a borehole using solar power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Eco-Village comprising the Passive House Prototypes was built in Port Harcourt south-eastern Nigeria, in the Niger Delta region. These homes were built as a comprehensive solution to the Nigerian housing, energy, water and sanitation crises. Nigeria, with a growing population of 180 million has a STAGGERING housing deficit of 17 million units. 33% of the population has access to improved sanitation, 45% to grid-sourced power, and 66% to clean water. For those connected to the grid, the power supply is epileptic and unreliable. Up to 70% of the population lives in single-room accommodation with shared bathrooms and kitchens. Home ownership is at (approximately) 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, eight low-income families moved from their water-side slum dwellings to the Eco-Village. They are thrilled to be living in decent accommodation with clean water, improved sanitation and solar power. They are off grid and do not use any form of mechanical ventilation, as the homes are endowed with adequate natural ventilation and lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Toothpick Project</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2017/toothpick-project</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Kenya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Toothpick Project addresses a critical problem: 40 million African smallholder farmers lose from 20-80% of their maize, sorghum, millet, and rice crops to Striga, a parasitic weed. Striga’s origin in Africa is unclear, but its devastation on smallholder farms has increased for the last seven decades. In Kenya, The Toothpick Project has designed and deployed an ecologically-sound solution: a biocontrol technology using a locally-sourced fungus substance, technically an “inoculum,” embedded onto a toothpick that kills Striga and improves crop yield by averages of more than 50%. With the large majority of Kenya maize farmers being women, they have designed a delivery system that uses women’s knowledge of food preparation to prepare the inoculum substrate - making this a gender-based food security solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; African smallholder farmers worst weed, Striga, depletes 20-80% of their maize, sorghum, millet, and rice yields. Imagine you are a woman smallholder farmer with only your farm for subsistence. You need a weed solution that is extremely low cost and with a proven return on your investment. You need something safe because you don&#039;t want to contaminate your soil or water. You need something accessible and easy to use. Your motivation is first and foremost the need to feed your family. Once this is accomplished, you hope to have enough surplus to sell. With this income, your top priority is to send your children to school. However, sometimes you need these funds for malaria or other illness. And, on top of this, you hope to improve your farm by planting more crops for increased nutrition and income. Though biological control with safely enhanced fungi can&#039;t promise to address these concerns directly, we believe it has a big future in Africa because it fiercely attacks one of the roots of these farmers&#039; problems. This trimtab technology is ripe for advancement but, in developed countries, the agriculture industry is already obliged to chemical pesticides. Biocontrol fits Africa perhaps better than anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The Toothpick Project is currently engaged in scaling up manufacturing and distribution in our initial country, Kenya. With the fall 2017 planting, we&#039;ll be developing distribution protocol and methods with four Kenyan NGOs, including advisory models and a kiosk shop. It is critical to expand into the other 17 countries ravished by Striga. To do this, we propose to train biological control scientists (up to ten countries in the first stage). The protocol for this technology is: Isolate (local adapted fungal strains), Field Test (in farmers fields), Enhance (by selecting amino acid excretion), Produce (primary inoculum in a certified laboratory), Register (with governmental agencies), Promote (using appropriate media), and Disseminate the biological control agent with instructions as to how it is best used (via biocontrol kiosks, agriculture outreach organizations, and governmental agricultural development programs already underway). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful production of locally-adapted biocontrol agents can sustain the productivity of smallholder farmers and subsequently provide an income to support the laboratory producing these biocontrol agents.  Within this system, there are several potential micro-industries (village-based live inoculum production).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of the newly formed network of trained scientists extends beyond Striga and Africa. These scientists will lead the way for integration of biocontrol globally.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Since entering the BFI Challenge in 2017, the Toothpick Project officially launched a social enterprise company in Kenya and has started scaling up their manufacturing capacity as well as the distribution process. This process involves continued labwork, trials and modifications with the end goal being a highly effective product that is affordable and accessible for all farmers. In January 2018 at Montana State University, scientists from twelve African Striga-striken countries were trained in the use of virulence-enhancement technology with their own locally-isolated fungal strains. Now, multi-national efforts are taking place to expand the research, trials, and commercialization in countries across sub-Saharan Africa. The Toothpick Project is currently seeking partnerships with farm input distribution NGOs, particularly in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Cameroon, Cote d&#039;Ivoire, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, and Mali. Also in 2017, the Toothpick Project was a MassChallenge 2017 Finalist, was part of the Montana State University Blackstone Launchpad 406Labs Accelerator, and participated in the SOCAP17 Entrepreneur Scholarship program. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; ZeroFly Livestock is the first insecticide-incorporated screen that keeps livestock healthy and productive by reducing the impact of nuisance and biting flies, such as tsetse flies, which are the vector of trypanosomiasis (also known as sleeping sickness or Nagana).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Initiatives are required to promote partnerships so that the Congolese can move away from exploitative artisanal mining to more modern approaches that employ appropriate labour and environmental safeguards. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the country with the highest prevalence of HAT, accounting for more than 70% of cases reported worldwide. The transmission rate is high and it is estimated that more than 12 million people are at risk of the disease. The tsetse fly, Glossina species, is the vector of trypanosomiasis, also known as African sleeping sickness, for the human and animal disease (HAT &amp;amp; AAT). Through reducing/removing the vector burden both the human and animal diseases can be reduced and potentially eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge of the urban population growth includes, amongst others, reliable food supplies in sufficient quantities and at sustainable prices. Of the many assets farmers have, livestock is one of the most important. Cattle &amp;amp; pigs provide sustenance in the form of meat and milk. Intensification of pig production is suggested as a first step in providing a sustainable solution for national food security. This project concept is supporting the MDGs 1, 4 &amp;amp; 5 by strengthening communities self-sufficiency through increased food productivity and improved health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; As part of the initiative Re-think DRC, Vestergaard committed to increase livestock (pig) productivity in the area around Kinshasa, DRC through a pilot study addressing the debilitating impacts of the tsetse fly that causes Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) and Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). The pilot can also be easily transferrable to zero-grazing of high producing dairy cattle that can suffer even higher levels of disease in the northern and eastern regions of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has a multi-disciplinary approach, with the main aim of strengthening and improving the links between human and animal health, agriculture and improved nutritional outcomes. Alongside decreasing poverty and hunger, the increase in self-sufficiency will lead to reduced imports and if scaled up provide a significant boost to the local and national economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot study consists of a two year follow-up of pig production (exotic cross breed) under two treatments following a longitudinal, prospective, single blind and controlled study design. The treatment groups placed in two closely matched sites 700 meters apart; site one with the intervention (ZeroFlyå Livestock) and site two acting as the control (no protection). The Province of Kinshasa was chosen as the study area since it is a historical HAT foci.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; MASS Design Lab is a research project of MASS Design Group, exploring the integration of public health, economic development, environmental performance and education into a comprehensive formalized architectural strategy through a rigorous assessment process and immersive community component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Design and public health operate in near-isolation and yet the consequences of both are inextricably linked. In 2010, over 250,000 people in Haiti were killed when one earthquake leveled buildings and devastated infrastructure. Three years later, Port-au-Prince remains vulnerable to disease as a result of a failed built environment. In Rwanda, the built environment contributes to high infant mortality rates and hospitals that spread disease. This toll is not unique to the developing world. The American Medical Association estimates that 80,000 people die annually due to hospital acquired infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating health considerations with building design is critical to resolving these devastating societal issues, but the research and social capital required is fiscally unachievable using current modes of practice. Buildings in the developing world are largely designed in isolation from the communities they serve. Often, local construction processes and materials are ignored and replaced by building systems with little cultural or economic relevance, perpetuating a systematic reliance on aid. MDLab develops a better built environment by implementing a practice based on investment in anticipatory social capacity that performs under crisis and change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Since 2008, MASS has developed significant immersive expertise through the design and construction of buildings, products, and policy in 7 countries. MASS has realized that architectural design in isolation cannot foster systematic improvement without an investment in research and training. MDLab embodies a practice that, through the development and dissemination of knowledge, leverages the potential of design to enable social innovation to respond to today’s greatest challenges.                     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, MDLab has identified four initiatives to be pursued during a three-year development phase:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Quantitative building assessment in the context of health, environment, and economy;&lt;br /&gt;
2) Development of policy initiatives for improved guidelines for safer buildings that exhibit better performance;&lt;br /&gt;
3) Use of local materials and innovative building technologies;&lt;br /&gt;
4) Dissemination of new knowledge through advocacy and education.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on knowledge gained through systematic research, MDLab conducts training programs to build internal capacity within MASS as well as expand the possibility of economic and social development through field workshops to engage communities and foster academic partnerships globally. Initially, research/training centers will be established in Rwanda and Haiti to begin prototyping processes for global application. For example, in Butaro, Rwanda a rural housing initiative has been launched as a communal effort, serving immediate needs and fostering growth through skill building in safe construction practices. This housing initiative creates means for collaborative exchange between local workers, students from the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), and universities worldwide. The research – training – design – construction workflow will link social and health outcomes with design, and generate a replicable feedback loop for global change. Additionally, the research conducted at the Butaro-based building lab will serve as small-scale tests for building technologies that can be translated to large-scale infrastructural buildings throughout Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
