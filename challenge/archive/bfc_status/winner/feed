  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don&#039;t bother trying to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; –R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change’s most severe impacts often fall on rural communities in developing countries hampered by financial, infrastructural, and other constraints. Globally, 260 million farmers are adversely affected by too much or too little water—floods, erratic rain, and droughts. In India alone, 6.72 million hectares of land are affected by this instability, dramatically contributing to food-insecurity and oppressive indebtedness for the poorest rural dwellers. Many irrigation solutions are not affordable and difficult to access. Aside from short-term losses of crops, the cycle of flood and drought typical of monsoon regions damages soil fertility in the long-term, leading to a vicious cycle of indebtedness and ecological degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rural women farmers suffer most acutely as a result of these hardships. In many cases, women do the majority of agricultural work, but they are at the bottom of the social hierarchy and are considered laborers rather than farmers, as men still own the land, control women’s labor, and make important agricultural decisions due to patriarchal social systems that dominate rural life nearly everywhere. In the absence of independent resources, women are far more vulnerable to poverty and destitution in cases of desertion, divorce, or the death of their husbands. Even for widows who become smallholders, irrigation scarcity and the effects of recurring disasters make it difficult to profitably cultivate the land that they are left with. In many cases, local power groups take advantage of these women’s vulnerabilities and capture their lands by manipulating their financial indebtedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sustainable Green Initiative Forum has designed Bhungroo (in Gujarati, “straw” or “hollow pipe”), an innovative technology that can filter, inject, and store storm water up to a depth of 300 meters in the subsoil. Operating in the Gujarat state of India with consultancy-based projects in Bangladesh, Ghana, Togo, and Vietnam, Bhungroo has 17 technical designs for water management in a variety of soil types and agro-climatic zones that can be customized based on 27 variables. Using only 1 square meter of surface area, Bhungroo allows multiple farmers to collectively preserve and retrieve stored rainwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an area where female farmers are often disregarded as contributing members of society, this exemplary social enterprise also has a non-profit component that trains women who are smallholder farmers to collectively own the subsoil water stored by Bhungroo and to provide fee-based services to other smallholder farmers in their village, confronting repressive social structures that have dominated the region for 400 years. Their program will be made available to illiterate farmers through the development of an app that utilizes a pictorial format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the provision of a simple yet elegant, trimtab-like technology, Bhungroo can equip smallholder farmers to be able to face drought, monsoon flooding, and unpredictable precipitation patterns related to climate change while simultaneously empowering women and the poorest of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Rainforest Solutions Project</title>

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;em&gt;[Design Science is] the effective application of the principles of science to the conscious design of our total environment in order to help make the Earth&#039;s finite resources meet the needs of all humanity without disrupting the ecological processes of the planet.&lt;/em&gt;” –R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Rainforest Solutions Project is a unique and innovative coalition consisting of Greenpeace, Sierra Club BC and Stand (formerly ForestEthics) and formed as a project of Tides Canada Initiative. For almost 2 decades, they have had a singular mission of “pioneering collaboration between deeply divergent interests (government, First Nations, environmentalists and logging companies) in the Great Bear Rainforest to develop a world-leading legal and policy framework called Ecosystem-Based Management”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; The Rainforest Solutions Project embraces the conservation challenge of simultaneously meeting human and ecological wellbeing. They played a critical role in identifying a science-based threshold for ecological integrity in coastal temperate rainforests to limit industrial logging activities, and helped to develop a new social and economic decision-making framework. Their approach speaks to an intimate understanding of the problem that few organizations have been able to successfully tackle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The decades-long struggle over British Columbia&#039;s enormous coastal rainforests culminated in one of the most extraordinary conservation, social justice, and indigenous rights victories in recent memory: a historic multi-generational agreement between the parties to conserve and sustainably manage the 15-million acre Great Bear Rainforest, one of the largest old growth temperate rainforests on the planet. Eighty-five percent of these forests are now legally off-limits to logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rainforest Solutions Project’s cutting-edge work to collaboratively co-design Ecosystem Based Management in the Great Bear Rainforest has resulted in a 15-million acre case study for the paradigm shift required to concurrently respect indigenous rights and conserve the Earth’s lungs, for species, culture and climate, now and for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design element of this project is the method of principled, multilateral negotiations that respects and upholds indigenous rights; fosters partnerships between divergent economic, political, and ecological values; and embraces the scale and complexity at which all of these systems operate. The Rainforest Solutions Project also maps out the often unglamorous but so necessary measures of knowledge transfer, monitoring, and continued problem-solving required to sustain such an achievement. This is the design of a model for healthy interaction between human beings and Spaceship Earth involving larger, longer, and more complex interrelationships.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>GreenWave</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/greenwave</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; -R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; GreenWave is a non-profit organization that has designed the world’s first multi-species 3D ocean farms, aiming to restore ocean ecosystems and create jobs in coastal communities by transforming fishers into restorative ocean farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; The ocean that we swim in today has changed more in our lifetime than in any other similar period in the past 300 million years. Meanwhile, over three billion people rely on our ocean’s marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. As humans, we have a stunning capacity to destroy the environment and the resources we depend on to survive. Fortunately, millions of years ago, Mother Nature, invented two technologies designed to mitigate our harm: seaweeds and shellfish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; This new approach moves us from growing vulnerable monocultures to creating vibrant ecosystems, which work to rebuild biodiversity and produce higher yields. The infrastructure is simple: seaweed, scallops and mussels grow on floating ropes, stacked above oyster and clam cages below. From these crops ocean farmers can produce food, fertilizers, animal feeds, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, biofuels and much more. The farms are designed to restore, rather than deplete our ecosystems. A single acre filters millions of gallons of ocean water every day, creates homes for hundreds of wild marine and bird species and absorbs the overabundance of nitrogen and carbon (with kelp sequestering 5x more carbon than land based-plants) that are killing billions of organisms. The design requires zero-inputs—there is no need for fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;GreenWave exemplifies beautifully Fuller’s inspirational call for individuals and groups to take the initiative, identify a critical issue, and tackle it independently, creatively, responsibly, and in a comprehensive manner,&lt;/em&gt;” said Michael Ben-Eli, former colleague of Buckminster Fuller and Senior Advisor to the Fuller Challenge, and Founder of The Sustainability Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE FULLER CHALLENGE CRITERIA:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visionary&lt;/strong&gt; – GreenWave synthesizes existing technologies into an integrative aquaculture system and sustainable business model that seeks to repair the way that humans interact with ocean ecosystems. Their vision of transforming the last ocean hunters into restorative ocean farmers is one that aligns with Fuller’s vision of all of humanity being able to “make it”, successfully and sustainably, by doing more with less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive&lt;/strong&gt; – GreenWave not only proposes a sustainable, integrated system within its 3D ocean farm model, but also applies a whole-systems approach to real-world deployment by proposing an affordable, open-source business model. GreenWave’s combined approach to ecological restoration, innovative food production, and sustainable business would generate a cascade of economic and environmental benefits to the communities in which it is implemented. They measure varied impacts such as: jobs created, storm mitigation, nitrogen sequestration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticipatory&lt;/strong&gt; – GreenWave looks toward future possibilities for ocean-grown resources, and is actively working with both research institutes and industry partners in order to offer 3D ocean farmers a range of opportunities for product development, including: food, fertilizer, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, biofuels, and more. In particular, they are working to develop markets for seaweed as a sustainable alternative for protein in the human diet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecologically Responsible&lt;/strong&gt; – The GreenWave model reflects nature’s underlying principles by proposing zero-input, closed-loop, multi-species aquaculture systems that filter water, restore coastal ecosystems, sequester carbon, and support biodiversity. Rather than simply minimizing harm, GreenWave’s model is ecologically regenerative, and productively enhances human life support systems by presenting an alternative to conventional agriculture, fishing, and aquaculture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasible&lt;/strong&gt; – Using simple infrastructure, GreenWave’s flagship farm on the Thimble Islands has the capacity to grow 10 tons of sea vegetables and 250,000 shellfish annually on one acre with zero input and no fresh water requirements. This same one-acre farm is able to filter millions of gallons of ocean water daily. The model’s low entry barrier requires 20 acres of leased ocean, a boat, and $30,000 of start-up costs, and can provide a higher than median income (around $70,000 per year).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verifiable&lt;/strong&gt; – Over 12 years, the GreenWave team has secured vital partnerships and demonstrated that their model is financially scalable. GreenWave cites research that points to the viability of seaweed to supply biofuel as well as human dietary protein. Partnerships include Echoing Green, the Hall Foundation, USDA, University of Connecticut, Yale University, Woods Hole Research Center, Fishackathon, Future of Fish, multiple National Aquariums, Points of Light, the Centre for Social Innovation, Whole Foods, Google, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replicable&lt;/strong&gt; – GreenWave is disseminating their model for restorative 3D ocean farms by open-source manuals, farmer training programs, and an online collaboration platform to create a network of restorative ocean farming communities. Outside of ongoing replication along the waters of the Long Island Sound, 3D ocean farmers anywhere in the world will be able to select appropriate native species to restore productive ecosystems along the coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, please visit GreenWave&#039;s website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenwave.org&quot;&gt;http://greenwave.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE (2018):&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Since being honored with the Buckminster Fuller Award, GreenWave has undergone major expansion. We now support an emerging network of &#039;GreenWave Reefs&#039; in New England, California, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska - with each reef made up of ocean farmers, hatcheries, processors, and entrepreneurs - and are in the process of establishing a European program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are developing an open source ocean farming platform for growth combined with farm sensor technology to empower farmers to collect and aggregate farm and reef-level data and create a community space for all restorative ocean farming stakeholders. This technology would not only turn each farm into a data engine by providing real-time tracking of data points, like farm-level carbon and nitrogen mitigation banking, but would also supply the connective tissue for farmers, researchers, wholesalers, investors, and others to share data, bolster restorative ocean farming practices, spur investment, and guide future ocean farming development. We are also creating a founding set principles for our growing industry akin to the principles of permaculture developed in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last three years, we have been featured in Time Magazine’s &#039;The 25 Best Inventions of 2017&#039;, Rolling Stones’ &#039;25 People Shaping the Future&#039;, and have been awarded both the 2017 Index: Design to Improve Life Award and 2017 Sustainia Award. We credit the Buckminster Fuller&lt;br /&gt;
Institute for taking our work to the next level and for all the support we have received since winning the award.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Living Breakwaters</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2014/living-breakwaters</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Living Breakwaters project combines coastal resiliency infrastructure with habitat enhancement techniques and community engagement, deploying a layered strategy that links in-water protective forms to on-shore interventions. We aim to mitigate the risk to humans from periodic weather extremes, improve the quality of our everyday lives, and rebuild our ecosystem.”&lt;/em&gt; —Kate Orff, Project Director, Living Breakwaters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Living Breakwaters is a comprehensive design for coastal resiliency along the Northeastern Seaboard of the United States and beyond. This approach to climate change adaptation and flood mitigation includes the deployment of innovative, layered ecologically-engineered breakwaters, the strengthening of biodiversity and coastal habitats through “reef streets”, the nurturing and resuscitation of fisheries and historic livelihoods, and deep community engagement through diverse partnerships and innovative educational programs. The transformative educational dimension amplifies impact to the next generation of shoreline stewards while leveraging the expertise of the members of the SCAPE Architecture team, who are making groundbreaking inroads into state and federal agencies, setting new precedents for multi-layered and systemic approaches to infrastructure planning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Our team embraced the coastal protection potential of the existing landscape along the Northeastern Seaboard of the United States, comprised of a network of coastal edges, shallow waters, and bay systems. Within the New York region, Staten Island and Raritan Bay is a complex and critical area of topography, maritime economies, and recreation, and hosts historic ecosystems which are under threat of disappearing. Already stressed by a history of expanding urbanization patterns and increasing population density, climate change is bringing new challenges to this region. Its predicted effects include a rise in mean temperature and precipitation, and accelerated sea level rise. Because of its geographic location and the occurrence of periodic weather extremes like hurricanes, New York City faces a high degree of potential risk, compared to places like The Netherlands. These phenomena, coupled with the excess nitrogen levels in our waters from treated wastewater and fertilizers, put our critical estuaries and bays at risk of disappearing within decades, if not years. We know that a loss of these endangered landscapes would threaten not only the cultural connection to our waters but also destroy the crucial absorptive ecological infrastructure that helps reduce risk for communities located along the water’s edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The concept for breakwaters originated through a Museum of Modern Art invited exhibition looking at sea level rise and New York City called Rising Currents. Our Oyster-tecture concept envisioned the rebuilding of oyster habitat at strategic locations along the coastline for wave attenuation and to create a new ‘blue park’, engaging a social and cultural element of the city. After the exhibition we developed the project into a more complete system, relying minimally on the oyster and more on the expanded habitat potential of other shellfish and the creation of breakwaters through specialized concrete installations like our SIMS Habitat Pier pilot project. The dedication to creating new social spaces and enlivening the cultural opportunities of the New York waterfront gained in importance over the life of the research and pilots. Living Breakwaters was developed through a series of meetings with community members and stakeholders have been held to collectively brainstorm on how to best program and occupy the proposed interventions. The Tottenville pilot will be used to study the ecological benefits, wave reduction impacts, and the economic and recreational potential, as well as bring these benefits to the Tottenville community now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/styles/content_alpha/public/images/ideas/LIVING%20BREAKWATERS_03%20Small.jpg?itok=UON371m-&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;392&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-content_alpha&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Living Breakwaters project acknowledges the fact that risk is embedded in all coastal resiliency strategies. Rather than cutting communities off from the water with a levee or wall, our approach embraces the water and its economic and recreational opportunities, using shallow water landscapes to stabilize the shore and rebuild diverse habitats. Sitting at the mouth of the New York Bight, Staten Island is particularly vulnerable to wave action and erosion. Our pilot project at the southernmost tip of Staten Island, in Tottenville, utilizes a layered system of breakwaters, constructed of ecologically engineered concrete, to attenuate wave action, create habitat for juvenile fish, and provide calm waters for recreation on the landward side. We have designed ‘reef street’ micro-pockets of habitat complexity to host finfish, shellfish, and lobsters, and hydrodynamically modeled the breakwater system at a macro scale to understand how and where they can most effectively protect communities. Structures called Water Hubs are located at critical points along the shore to serve as places of gathering for classes, orientation, kayak &amp;amp; equipment. Our initial project aims to protect the South Shore of Staten Island but the concept, through site-specific study, could be replicable along much of the U.S. coastline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Living Breakwaters project aims at reducing risk, and making the threat legible and part of everyday life while growing ecological habitat and building social resiliency. This proposal aims to step down risk with each investment, redefine scales of harm, and move beyond the impossible scenario of enclosing ‘dry’ from ‘wet’ to address larger long-term issues of ecosystem collapse, cycles of regional decline, and managed, calmer, and non-disastrous inundation events. The Team developed a framework to link people with the shoreline and with the water through education, engagement, and the expansion of a water-based recreational economy. The project strengthens ongoing shoreline improvements and creates opportunities for rethinking the coastal edge. For example, new dune systems created by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation will be protected from erosion by the offshore breakwater system, and new seawall constructions can incorporate living marsh elements due to lower wave velocity. The proposed project will revive ecologies, inspire a new generation of harbor stewards, and build a more resilient region over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SCAPE team is composed of SCAPE/LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE with Parsons Brinckerhoff, Dr. Philip Orton / Stevens Institute of Technology, Ocean &amp;amp; Coastal Consultants, SeArc Ecological Consulting, LOT-EK, MTWTF, The Harbor School and Paul Greenberg. This project was refined as part of President Obama’s Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force Rebuild by Design initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/styles/content_alpha/public/images/ideas/scape-banner.jpg?itok=AWPhU3fI&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;224&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-content_alpha&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selected Comments from Advisors and Jurors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Living Breakwaters is about dissipating and working with natural energy rather than fighting it. It is on the one hand an engineering and infrastructure-related intervention, but it also has a unique biological function as well. The project team understand that you cannot keep back coastal flooding in the context of climate change, but what you can do is ameliorate the force and impact of 100 and 500 year storm surges to diminish the damage through ecological interventions, while simultaneously catalyzing dialog to nurture future stewards of the built environment.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; — &lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge/about/selection-process/advisory-team/bill-browning&quot;&gt;Bill Browning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Living Breakwaters has huge, worldwide implications, both in its understanding of how to communicate ecological issues to the local community within its own context, as well as in its rigorous, multi-disciplinary research and smart use of technology. Aside from the solid science, planning, and building approach, the most compelling aspect of this project is its community involvement through the engagement with students working on real-world science problems and being part of the solution to a local coastal problem that could contribute to similar solutions worldwide.&lt;/em&gt;” — &lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge/about/selection-process/advisory-team/susan-szenasy&quot;&gt;Susan Szenasy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Challenge of Appalachia</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2008/challenge-appalachia</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Challenge of Appalachia lays out a strategy for transforming one and a half million acres of strip-mined lands in Appalachia into a harmonious self-sustaining community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;There are over one and a half million acres of strip-mined lands in Appalachia. Coal mining practices have removed mountaintops and filled valleys with the resulting overburden. Landscapes and communities have been devastated. The primary rationale for this is that the nation needs the coal for electricity. Fifty percent of the USA’s electricity comes from burning coal. However, coal combustion is creating increasing levels of carbon dioxide, triggering climate change and threatening the ecological integrity of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an alternative future for Appalachia. It is the antithesis of the current economy of the region. This is a future in which carbon is no longer an atmospheric pollutant but is sequestered in soils and biota. Mining toxins are remediated, coal lands restored, and a new economy is based upon renewable energy, natural resources, enterprise diversification and an ownership society.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt;This project sets forth a revolutionary concept for the design of an entirely new economic model for a region that has been despoiled by extractive industries. Dr. John Todd’s vision is inextricably bound to a set of highly advanced ecological design principles that he developed. Appropriately, they reflect not only deep understanding of biological systems, but also the best creative intelligence and cultural wisdom spanning the centuries. These principles are the fruit of Dr. Todd’s decades-long practice developing technologies around the world that build healthy symbiotic relationships between nature’s living systems and modern human needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project’s methodology fully recognizes that transformation requires re-conceiving virtually every aspect of how we go about valuing and meeting our life support needs. Accordingly, Todd’s design strategy takes on regionally specific interactions within and between the biosphere, the economy, the local community, the concept of ’right livelihood’, the development of new technology, and education. Its overarching goal is to model a post-industrial economy that mirrors the diverse abundance, cyclic patterns and structural resilience of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Todd proposes a four-stage replicable process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Healing. The first stage in the transformation of the region will involve the detoxifying the trillions of gallons of coal slurry that is held in reservoirs throughout the region. This involves eco-machines designed to render the material harmless to the environment and local inhabitants as well as to create beneficial products from the treated slurry solids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Carbon Sequestration and the Creation of a Working Landscape. Once deep soils and ground cover are established, the next stage will involve creating a working landscape through a series of successional stages. This will include a regional reforestation initiative, which has already been researched and is in the planning phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Creating a Renewable Energy Future. Suitable Appalachian wind sites already have been discovered that can provide competitive sources of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Institutions and a Shared Ownership Culture. A multi-phase institutional model can cover operations at scales ranging from a watershed to an entire region. There are three broad steps: philanthropic, capitalized corporations, and cooperatives for divesting the land and expanding services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Sustainable Urban Mobility</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2009/sustainable-urban-mobility</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; MIT Media Lab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Boston, Massachusetts, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the 2009 Fuller Challenge Jury:&lt;/strong&gt; The Sustainable Personal Mobility and Mobility-on-Demand System designs were submitted by an interdisciplinary student team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab Smart Cities Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the nature of the crises we are facing, from climate change to economic collapse, what is important is to demonstrate that this approach to design and problem solving—while always thinking big—has the potential to bring about changes in the near-term. This project is a perfect example of the kind of radical, transformative change that is possible when we reconceive the old ways of doing things and take a systems-based approach to design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This initiative isn&#039;t just about the design of these lightweight, highly efficient, electric vehicles, it is about inserting that technological innovation into the social and cultural environment and designing an intuitive system within which they function. The technological innovation embodied in these vehicles is just one piece of a larger system design which addresses issues from pollution, to congestion, to urban space, to economics, to energy use, to the very idea of personal transportation and what that means in a world with nearly seven billion inhabitants.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; This initiative includes the design of lightweight, highly efficient, electric vehicles, and encompasses the framework in which the technological innovations are integrated into the urban social and cultural environment by designing an intuitive and functional system which utilizes advanced &#039;smart grid&#039; technologies. The team from MIT&#039;s Media Lab have designed several new battery-electric vehicles – the CityCar, the RoboScooter, and the GreenWheel electric bicycle – that are utilized within mobility-on-demand systems. All of these vehicles are extremely lightweight, have small footprints, have no tailpipe emissions, and are extremely frugal in energy use. This is accomplished without compromising safety, comfort, convenience, or fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; The gasoline-powered private automobile was one of the greatest inventions of all time. Over the last century, it has radically transformed our daily lives and the forms of our cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it has become increasingly apparent that there are strict limits to scales at which automobile-based personal mobility systems can effectively and responsibly operate, and that we are fast approaching those limits. The proximity of limits shows up in the forms of rapidly growing negative externalities to automobile use – urban congestion, peripheral sprawl and inefficient land-use, excessive energy-use, petroleum dependence and the associated geopolitical/economic problems, local air and noise pollution, and carbon emissions contributing substantially to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to these problems, incremental improvements to automobile and road infrastructure technology are often worth pursuing. However, these technologies are very highly evolved and mature, so there is limited benefit to be derived from further evolution. An evolutionary path to improvement will not have a sufficient impact, within the necessary time frame, on the pressing problems of urban sustainability and global climate change. Instead, a radical reinvention of urban personal mobility systems is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have designed several new battery-electric vehicles – the CityCar, the RoboScooter, and the GreenWheel electric bicycle – that are utilized within mobility-on-demand systems. All of these vehicles are extremely lightweight, have small footprints, have no tailpipe emissions, and are extremely frugal in energy use. This is accomplished without compromising safety, comfort, convenience, or fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobility-on-demand systems provide racks of these vehicles at closely spaced, convenient locations around an urban service area. Vehicles automatically recharge while they are in these racks. Users walk to the nearest rack, swipe a credit card, pick up a vehicle, drive it to a rack convenient to their destination, and drop it off. These are, in other words, ubiquitously distributed one-way rental systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These systems are highly efficient in reducing urban congestion, energy use, and carbon emissions. They are synergistic with ubiquitous wireless networking and distributed intelligence, and with solar-friendly, wind-friendly, fuel-cell-friendly smart electrical grids. There are some attractive business models for their introduction, and the political and economic climate is increasingly propitious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Our team has finished conceptual design for both the electric vehicles and the mobility-on-demand system. We are now engaged in the design development and have produced working prototypes for each of the vehicles including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.        CityCar – Full-scale working prototype of the chassis.&lt;br /&gt;
2.        RoboScooter – 2 show car quality full-scale prototypes, the first of which was showcased at the Milano Motorcycle show in November 2007.&lt;br /&gt;
3.        GreenWheel Bicycle – Full-scale working prototype showcased at the Copenhagen conference on SmartBiking (prelude to the November 2009 U.N. Conference on Climate Change). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have researched the top vehicle sharing systems in Asia, Europe, and the US and closely examined the world’s largest mobility-on-demand system, the Paris Vélib bicycle system, which employees over 20,000 bicycles and 1200 racks. This has allowed us to distill a best practices strategy for implementing a profitable and sustainable transportation system including sizing of the fleet, station placement, maintenance, and fleet logistics. We have also developed a system dynamics model which anticipates user demand and optimizes the vehicle supply chain.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team has engaged in discussions with the political leaders of San Francisco, London, Florence, Lisbon, Taipei, and Bangalore and has developed implementation plans for these cities. We have also created business models that account for the implementation and initial rollout, marketing, system growth, maintenance, and overall economic sustainability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will utilize the prize money for technical development and business modeling as a basis for pursing venture capital. Phase 1 implementation includes a pilot on MIT and Harvard’s campus, with the purpose of testing our system in a manageable area where we can learn and improve the system before full-scale deployment. The pilot including planning and implementation will take 2 years. The 3rd year will be devoted to city-scale deployment in of our candidate cities (mentioned above). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Operation Hope</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2010/operation-hope</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operation Hope demonstrates how to reverse desertification of the world’s savannas and grasslands, thereby contributing enormously to mitigating climate change, biomass burning, drought, flood, drying of rivers and underground waters, disappearing wildlife, massive poverty and social breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allan Savory is a Zimbabwean wildlife biologist, farmer, soldier, environmentalist, and a true pioneer in a field that he virtually created himself—the field of holistic rangeland management. He co-founded the Center for Holistic Management in 1984 and currently operates under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savoryinstitute.com/&quot;&gt;Savory Institute&lt;/a&gt;. Savory&#039;s approach to reversing desertification is common sense but very counter-intuitive and accordingly has been challenged over the years in many scientific, academic and policy circles because it challenges prevailing wisdom. However, a growing body of practitioners around the world, who have been influenced by his lectures, workshops, and published works, are applying his innovative management principles with great success. The Africa Center for Holistic Management, a 6,500-acre rangeland learning center that he created in 1992, is governed by a small group of trustees including Savory and five African chiefs. The work of the Center is a testament to the breakthrough methods for reversing desertification and its insidious impact on livelihoods, biodiversity and climate change. He has transformed large swaths of parched and degraded areas of the ranch into lush pastures replete with ponds and flowing streams even during periods of drought.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Globally, tropical coastal ecosystems are critical to livelihoods, cultures and food security of hundreds of millions of people, but are in unabated decline due to overexploitation and climate change. Throughout much of the developing world fragile marine resources are under siege from a range of human and climatic impacts, with less than 1% of marine ecosystems under effective protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a paucity of marine resource governance globally Blue Ventures works alongside partner communities at remote conservation sites. Data collected on the status of marine environments, analysed in partnership with community leaders, are widely disseminated so that communities begin to understand the ecological condition of their marine environment as well as the biological and economic case for conservation management as a tool for restocking depleted fisheries and safeguarding ecosystem resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Ventures works to develop community owned marine conservation solutions through an ambitious portfolio encompassing marine and fisheries research, sustainable aquaculture, family planning and public health, environmental education, fisheries management and protected area development. Integrating such a broad range of initiatives and delivering them in a specific geographic area represents a novel approach to the development of sustainable and holistic community led marine and coastal conservation in tropical developing world countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>The Living Building Challenge</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2012/living-building-challenge</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;The Living Building Challenge is especially important at this make-it-or-break-it moment when humanity must rapidly address climate change in disruptive, systematic ways. At a cusp when world populations continue to place increasingly radical strains on the biosphere, innovating on how we redesign the built environment is imperative.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
–Kenny Ausubel, 2012 Fuller Challenge Juror&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Living Building Challenge defined the highest level of environmental performance, envisioning a built environment that is fully integrated with its ecosystem. It pushed the building industry to re-imagine business as usual, and transformed building occupants from passive consumers into active stewards of increasingly scarce resources.  At a cusp when world populations continue to place increasingly radical strains on the biosphere, innovating on how we redesign the built environment is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; The Living Building Challenge was launched in 2006 by Jason McLennan as a direct response to the pressures that the accelerating rate of urbanization and impending resource scarcity will place on humanity. It aims to further a design paradigm that minimizes the built environment’s toxic effluents, its destruction of habitats and ecosystems, and its contribution to carbon emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The Living Building Challenge (LBC) was administered by the International Living Future Institute. The Living Building Challenge is a third-party building certification program. Unlike other green building certification programs, such as the US Green Building Council’s LEED standard, the Living Building certification is not awarded based on design and performance projections; it is awarded only after the building is completed and has been in operation for at least one year. What makes the Living Building Challenge unique is that it is not only a performance standard, but also a design philosophy and even an advocacy tool. It called for the creation of building projects at all scales (from single-room renovations to whole communities) that operate as cleanly, beautifully and efficiently as nature&#039;s architecture. To achieve certification, a project must meet 20 rigorous Imperatives (including net-zero energy, waste and water) over a minimum of 12 months of continuous occupancy. The Institute certified the first projects to fully achieve the LBC in October 2010, proving that the LBC is attainable now, using existing technology. Approximately 140 more projects, spread across eight countries and twenty-eight U.S. states, are currently in progress. LBC Ambassadors, skilled volunteers dedicated to advancing the LBC in their home communities, are active in twenty-one countries. The LBC’s seven primary performance areas that are divided into a total of 20 imperatives: Site, Energy, Water, Health, Materials, Equity and Beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Embodying the Bucky maxim: &quot;To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; New York, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Ecovative has disrupted the materials industry with an innovative and cost-competitive natural alternative to petrochemical based plastics and other hazardous materials widely used daily across the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Plastic foams are made from finite and often-harmful petrochemicals, don’t biodegrade, and contribute to growing waste in landfills and our environment. As more cities recognize the hazards of many traditional materials, there is a gap on the supply side for alternatives to foam packaging, insulation, and other synthetics. Current regulatory systems ignore the long-term implications of exposure to toxicity, unpredictable waste streams, environmental degradation and natural resource depletion that these materials cause, and while life-cycle and ecosystem services analyses are gaining traction, for the most part, the negative impact of these products is not given the attention it deserves. Alternatives need to be not only environmentally friendly, but high-performing and cost-competitive as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Ecovative’s biomaterial platform technology resolves critical concerns for waste, energy, and consumer health by working with nature to grow an alternative. Ecovative fills a gap on the supply side for alternatives to foam packaging, insulation, and other synthetics. Their biomaterial platform technology resolves critical concerns for waste, energy, and consumer health by working with nature to grow an alternative. The innovative materials science company uses local agricultural waste as feedstock to grow fungal mycelia that can be formed into a host of byproducts, from packaging materials to building insulation and car components.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
