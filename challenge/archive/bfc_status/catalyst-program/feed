 <title>The Buckminster Fuller Institute - Catalyst Program</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/challenge/archive/bfc_status/catalyst-program</link>
 <description>Each year the BFC program awarded resources and support to an additional 40-60 projects through our Catalyst Program (including semifinalists, finalists, and the winner). The broader Catalyst Program group included projects that represented the top 20% of the entry pool. Benefits of the Catalyst Program included opportunities for additional funding, pro-bono legal services, fast-track access to accelerator programs, mentorship opportunities, and international press coverage.
In 2013, we created a Catalyst Program in order to extend the resources and support to more projects. Catalyst Program entrants typically constituted the top 20% of the entry pool, and were vetted by the review team. While these projects did not necessarily fulfill the BFC criteria to the degree that the semifinalists did, they were projects that excelled in their particular discipline or problem space.
Benefits of the Catalyst Program included opportunities for additional funding, pro-bono legal services, fast-tracked access to accelerator programs, mentorship opportunities, and international press coverage. In total we were able to extend over $750,000 in additional funding and support to qualified projects.
For example, In 2013 and 2014, select applicants were the recipients of additional funding procured through BFI. In 2015 and 2016, the BFC staff vetted Catalyst Program projects to receive grants from the World Centric giving program. Over the years, the Catalyst Program pool served as a source of rigorously vetted projects for other award programs, and our projects were recognized by the Autodesk Foundation, the World Habitat Awards, the World Design Impact Prize, The Roddenberry Foundation, the INDEX: Award, the Biomimicry Institute, and more. In some cases, as with the Katerva Awards, the BFC program served as a global spotter, and projects from our entry pool were automatically nominated.
Qualifying NGOs and social enterprises benefited from pro-bono legal assistance via BFI&#039;s referral process with the Thomson Reuters Foundation&#039;s global TrustLaw program. Up to two Fuller Challenge entrants had the opportunity to be selected from the general entry pool for nomination as Echoing Green Fellows each year in fulfillment of the BFC&#039;s Fast Track partnership with Echoing Green. Qualifying innovators were referred for inclusion in dMASS Inc.&#039;s depository of innovations, which facilitates the relationship between resource performance leaders and investors. Qualifying solutions were also referred for inclusion in Technology Exchange Lab&#039;s depository of appropriate technology solutions for issues of poverty. Select entrants were invited to present their work at future Bioneers conferences.
Additional opportunities to present work at events organized by BFI included Greenbuild, Architecting the Future symposia, Black Mountain College International Conference, The Cooper Union Institute of Sustainable Design lectures, and other international symposia on Buckminster Fuller, sustainable culture events, design conferences and social entrepreneurship gatherings.

 <title>The Copenhagen Wheel</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2011/copenhagen-wheel</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; A new strategy for sustainable mobility, The Copenhagen Wheel project aims to turn any city into a cycling-city. Our holistic solution is a new type of electric bike, and associated mobile applications - helps riders overcome topography and distance, fosters a cycling community, and supports long-term transportation and environmental policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Our mission is to develop new vehicles for personal transportation that offer compelling alternatives to the car. The original prototype for the Copenhagen Wheel was invented at MIT’s Senseable City Lab in partnership with the city of Copenhagen, one of the most innovative cities for biking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Cycling with the Copenhagen Wheel is the most magical ride you&#039;ll ever take. It&#039;s like riding a regular bike, but with super strength. The Wheel makes your bike an electric bicycle that synchronizes with your movements and amplifies your pedal power 10X. You go farther in less time, with less effort, and can get to places where you&#039;d usually need a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the ebike technology lives inside the brilliant red hub and connects to your smartphone. There are no buttons, wires, or external batteries. Just replace your back wheel and pedal! The Wheel&#039;s custom sensors, computers, battery and motor do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Sensitile Systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Michigan, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; POWERleap has developed a means to generate 100% renewable energy with nothing more than human footsteps. Our solution is a flooring system that uses piezoelectric technology to convert kinetic energy from people into electricity. Current tests show that 1 kwh of energy can be generated from a 50 m2 area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; A series of custom Terrazzo Lumina™ tiles were designed and created for designer and inventor, Elizabeth Redmond to help her demonstrate her POWERleap concept, which harnesses the energy in human footsteps to illuminate the floor. The tiles were provided with recesses for Piezo-electric transducers that capture the vibration from movement and convert it into a burst of LED light which is expressed into the surface of the tiles.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Clepsydra Urban Farming</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2011/clepsydra-urban-farming</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Clepsydra is a new building type - actually an accessory building- a vertical greenhouse that can be linked to existing or new buildings. Within the framework of answering urgent environmental and ecological challenges, Clepsydra serves as a multi-faceted urban development tool to provide food security and community life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; The concept of vertical farming is not something new, but we still seem to be a bit lethargic in adopting this practice. One of the major challenges facing vertical farming designers, is that once you build more than one floor of greenhouse, you must put systems in place to ensure that each level of the farm has the equal potential to grow food.  This means either designing rotation systems that move the crop to share the daylight needed for growth, or the installation of high cost, high energy consuming lights that simulate natural sunlight.  Clepsydra has multiple floors but addresses these challenges through passive design (utilizing the most light through the cylindrical shape of the building) as well as solar PV panels to assist in producing the energy needed to light the crops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The idea behind the design of the Clepsydra is to ensure that you do not go through much of a hassle to put up your own greenhouse structure. That hopefully will encourage more people to take up the feature. The Clepsydra can be joined to any existing home or other buildings like hospitals, schools or even commercial malls. The basic framework is put together rather quickly using industrial steel rods and avoiding welding time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-Story Clepsydra can produce food that is equivalent to 6 acres of farmland, on an average. With farmland shrinking each day thanks to our industrial and housing needs, options like these could provide a viable alternative. That said, the main intention of the Clepsydra is to eliminate the carbon emissions and resource wastage that is involved in food supply, transportation, storing, packaging and sales- from the farm to your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; We worked in Kampala during an early Ebola outbreak. We saw first hand the devastating consequences and need for a more cohesive, informed response plus collective innovation. This motivated us to develop a system intervention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Our initiative will use networks and communities of interest to build awareness, and find opportunities (e.g. outbreak responses) for impactful participation. This will establish new pathways for actions and insight across the disease eco-system that previously has not existed.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Burma Humanitarian Mission</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2016/burma-humanitarian-mission</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Burma (Myanmar) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; BHM supports community-based backpack medics who administer village health care services in Burma, grassroots education projects that empower the youth of Burma and projects that promote cross-cultural sharing and collaboration for refugees from Burma living in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Burma has one the world’s worst health care systems, with some of the highest rates of malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, dysentery, diarrhea and other communicable illnesses in the world. In the ethnic conflict areas of Burma, the government provides no healthcare. 15% of children die before their 5th birthday, mostly from illnesses that are easily preventable. Malaria accounts for nearly half of all deaths. 1 in 12 expecting mothers will not survive pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the election of Aung San Suu Ky&#039;s National League for Democracy to hold the majority of seats in parlimant, the Myanmar Army continues its assaults on the ethnic minorities. The Army attacks villages, killing citizens, burning crops and seizing land for international development. Rape is used as a weapon of war to intimidate communities. 650,000 people are internally displaced and at least twice as many are isolated without infrastructure. Others have fled the country, living in refugee camps or as undocumented workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; This project is ingeniously navigating a hostile regime and a difficult physical environment to provide grassroots, culturally integrated health care - and thus elegantly meeting critical needs. Trained in basic neo-natal care and childbirth, plus equipped with medicine, Backpack Medics travel among their people providing pre-natal, delivery, and post-delivery care. The ethnic medics speak their people providing pre-natal, delivery, and post-delivery care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our efforts start with supporting BPHWT to recruit and train the next generation of backpack medics.  These dedicated men and women learn the basics of first aid, medicines, maternal and child care and community health practices during a 7 month training program in a safe area of Karen State. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teams draw volunteers from all the ethnic groups in Burma to include the Karen, Karenni, Kachin, Palaung, Shan and Mon people. The priority goes to assisting those communities immediately affected by the Burma army’s violence or aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once trained, the new medics return to their villages and communities.  Some serve for a few years while others serve for decades. No matter how long they serve, BHM supports them with their required medicines and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backpack medics are instrumental as catalysts of change for their people.  The isolated villages and IDP camps lack the amenities of contemporary society – electricity, running water, paved roads and fixed structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medics provide a very proactive community health education program.  Their efforts focus on disease prevention for the most prevalent conditions:  malaria, dysentery, pneumonia and problem pregnancies.  They also promote sanitary conditions with securing clean water and building and instructing on how to build latrines.  The medics also share information on malnutrition, waste disposal, Vitamin A, de-worming medicine, and high-risk pregnancies. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Clean Energy Moonshot</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/clean-energy-moonshot</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; World Business Academy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Santa Barbara, California, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Clean Energy Moonshot is a new system for renewable energy production, management, and distribution that disrupts centralized monopolies by empowering communities to create their own energy. It addresses the need for a rapidly scalable implementation of renewable energy - a critical but currently unavailable component of the fight against climate catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Humanity must transition off of fossil fuels as soon as possible. To accomplish this, we must create a new system for the creation of energy to power our lives. In order to transition rapidly, this new system must be scalable, efficient, and flexibleŠ—”in other words, it should be a disruptive force that can out-compete the existing model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The technology to replace the fossil fuel economy with 100-percent renewable energy exists today. The missing link is a system that is reliable, resilient, financeable, and empowering for communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 1. Reliability: The new system must meet the modern need for energy (electricity as well as transportation and heating fuels).&lt;br /&gt;
 2. Resilience: The new system must withstand unprecedented storms, fires, flooding, and winds resulting from worsening environmental factors.&lt;br /&gt;
 3. Financing: The new system will require unprecedented investment. In order to rapidly scale, the new system must include attractive investment opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;
 4. Community Empowerment: As a top priority, the new system must benefit local communities. It must make regional economies stronger, air cleaner, and neighborhoods safer. It must go further, inspiring and incentivizing individuals to reduce their personal impact and to take responsibility for building a regenerative civilization.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;What? A localized but highly scalable system for the production, distribution, and storage of 100-percent renewable electricity provides all the power needed in a given region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Where? The launchpad begins in southern Santa Barbara County, California - a community at risk of catastrophic blackouts because of crumbling electricity transmission infrastructure. Santa Barbara is forward thinking, environmentally aware, and possesses influence to initiate and build a new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; How? A regional public education campaign leverages the highly educated and motivated population; developing the political will for replacing the crumbling, dirty energy system with a robust and modern renewable energy system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A Community Microgrid electricity system is designed and built, linking solar panels, wind turbines, fuel cells, and other proven distributed energy generation systems together using existing wires with some upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Local energy management and advanced software systems allow innovation in the pricing of energy. Local markets and incentives drive the mass deployment of local renewable energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Energy created and managed where utilized provides maximum efficiency. Excess renewable energy charges electric cars and is stored as hydrogen for later use in fuel cells and vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Demonstrated success spreads the meme, California&#039;s energy system becomes an interconnected network of Community Microgrids.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>WikiHouse Commons</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/wikihouse-commons</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; WikiHouse Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; WikiHouse is an open source building system. We are building a digital commons, where all designers, inventors &amp;amp; users collaborate to develop and share high-performance, low-cost, low-energy building solutions that are then owned by everyone. These solutions can be downloaded, locally &#039;printed&#039; and self-assembled to make sustainable, resilient, affordable homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The future is already here, it just isn&#039;t very distributed yet.&quot; — Gibson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; By 2050, 70% of the world&#039;s 9 billion population will live in cities. Those cities will have to be built without dependence on fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We do have the solutions to meet this challenge, yet the top-down industrial systems we inherited are failing to diffuse and deploy them. Even the most sustainable technology is useless if locked behind a proprietary licence, or prohibitively expensive to produce and distribute. This is especially the case in housing, where design industries expensively re-solve the same problems again and again, while reaching only 2% of the built environment. Since the industrial revolution, we have been dependent on centralised, top-down models of design and production of mass-housing: unsustainable, undemocratic and debt-heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &quot;It is easier to ship recipes than cakes and biscuits.&quot; — Keynes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In the last decade, the web transformed our information economy, from centralised to decentralised (eg Wikipedia). In the next, it could transform our industrial economy. Open design means no problem ever needs to be solved twice. Digital manufacturing puts distributed factory power into the hands of citizens and communities. Share global, print local. What does that mean for homes and neighbourhoods?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Most people&#039;s first encounter with the WikiHouse project is with the open source hardware solutions it produces. The first building technology in the system is a LEGO-like building system that can be shared online as code, uniquely adapted to its site and user, and then locally manufactured using a CNC machine costing $2000 or less. The parts are cut from standard, widely available, low-carbon sheet materials, resulting in a kit that can be assembled like a large IKEA kit. This can be built in days, even by amateurs, but provides a level of energy performance (eg: Passivhaus) which is, at present, prohibitively expensive. This initial technology is now being joined by a growing range of compatible kit solutions; for example a 3D-printed heat recovery ventilator, which can be locally manufactured with recycled materials for Î£24, but matches the performance of its Î£200 industry equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But, the deepest innovations of the WikiHouse project are not the products themselves, but the processes behind them: the operating principles, platform and protocols that allow these solutions to be shared online, then replicated and improved by an open community of designers, inventors and makers. Our proposed project initiative is to develop this digital commons.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Urbinsight: The EcoCitizen World Map Project</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2015/urbinsight-ecocitizen-world-map-project</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Ecocity Builders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Oakland, California, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Urbinsight project connects communities with web-based mapping tools designed to explore and measure holistic urban health from a citizens&#039; perspective. Based on a bottom-up approach to documenting environmental conditions at the neighborhood scale, the project provides tools, training, and knowledge for creating more sustainable, resilient urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Cities play a critical role in the quest for solutions to global environmental challenges. Recent decades have witnessed an increasing trend of concentration of the world&#039;s population in urban areas — by 2050 it is estimated that two-thirds of the world&#039;s population will live in cities. Urban areas currently account for 60% to 80% of the world&#039;s greenhouse gas emissions, and the numbers are similar for demand for water and energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; An important step in the process of addressing these challenges and creating effective solutions is the ability to understand, measure and quantify the environmental impacts of cities, in terms of consumption of energy and natural resources and generation of waste. There is a need for detailed, accurate data and information about local urban environmental conditions, as well as social and economic conditions that affect both the immediate quality of life for residents and the long-term resilience and sustainability of urban areas. Furthermore, access to such data and information is a key consideration, both for citizens (so that they can be involved in governance and action to improve environmental conditions and quality of life) and for local governments (in order to support good public policy, decision making and urban management).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Urbinsight uses GIS and online multimedia applications to graphically and spatially display information about the state of the urban ecosystem. The project is implemented in each pilot city through collaboration with local universities, community-based organizations, and government agencies. The key goals are to actively engage citizens in learning, planning, and advocating for their communities; and to provide original neighborhood-level data to complement official government data that can inform policy and decision-making for more sustainable cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urbinsight incorporates an educational component based on the &quot;EcoCompass&quot; curriculum, which includes participatory action research methods and learning forums. It also utilizes a methodology known as urban metabolism modeling, which measures the &quot;source to sink&quot; flows of resources, including water, energy and solid waste, as they move through the built environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial phase includes the creation of a base map that displays key features of the natural and built environment, as well as several urban environmental indicators (these initial data to be mapped are obtained from open government data sources). After taking part in workshops on participatory information technologies, citizens can then contribute community-generated data and upload their observations and reports about neighborhood conditions to the map via mobile phones or the web.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Cargo Collective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Barcelona, Spain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Physical spaces are static and not optimized to their context. Our initiative is a transformable, transportable envelope able to adjust to constantly changing users&#039; needs. Offering an optimized design to environmental conditions it generates a self-sustainable system.  Thus, it constitutes a dynamic sheltering solution to evolving heterotopic spaces, like refugee-camps.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Among different potential applications, we focus on the pilot application: Shelter.&lt;br /&gt;
 There are more than 50 million displaced people worldwide, due to conflicts, climate change and natural disasters, finding shelter in refugee camps.&lt;br /&gt;
 The vast majority has poor access to energy (0.2KWh), which in turn leads to limited education, healthcare and social activities. Considering that the population of a camp can reach hundreds thousand inhabitants, the yearly cost that humanitarian agencies have to bear for diesel generators accounts for millions of dollars, which in most cases is not affordable.&lt;br /&gt;
 To avoid dependency from the authorities, displaced people seek for alternative lighting/cooking resources such as traditional biomass and kerosene, inducing irreversible environmental degradation in the surrounding area. The actual implications have to do with deforestation, air pollution (due to fire lighting and gas consumed) and deterioration of opportunities for agriculture.&lt;br /&gt;
 Another crucial problem is the poor distribution of goods and services within the camps because of inflexible planning. Long distances to schools, ration distribution and medical centers makes them inaccessible.&lt;br /&gt;
 For the aforementioned reasons, violence arises between refugees and their hosts. The lack of security and short lifespan of tents has been reported an important parameter to improve refugees&#039; dignity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Our initiative proposes an adjustable sheltering structure, which can form itself into various real-time configurations upon users&#039; needs. Its flexibility allows it to be optimized to numerous parameters such as thermal comfort, ventilation, space distribution, number of users and potential uses (households, schools, medical centers etc.). Besides that, its foldability enables easy packaging, facilitating transportation, and the modularity of the design makes it scalable. Hence our system can be reused in diverse scenarios and locations.&lt;br /&gt;
 The solution derives from the properties of an existing responsive material called Shape Memory Polymer which can be transformed, upon heating, from rigid to flexible and can memorize its initial geometry. Through placing this material in critical nodes of our structure, and actuating it with an embedded heating system, we are able to trigger its deformation. These local deformations define the final overall shape by remodeling an origami-inspired pattern through folding and unfolding. To achieve the desired forms, an external actuation force is required.&lt;br /&gt;
 The high structural performance of the aforementioned material system empowers extended applications comparing to existing lightweight-flexible systems (pneumatics and tensegrity structures).&lt;br /&gt;
 Various prototypes have been successfully tested in the laboratory (see video below) to prove the technology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Urban Data Visualization Laboratory, University of Illinois at Chicago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Chicago, Illinois, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; We will develop a collaborative modeling and visualization protocol to effectively address water sustainability. We balance precision and comprehension, integrating coupled human-hydrological systems science into practical planning deliberative processes, to help citizens, planners, and scientists jointly make sense of complex water problems and harness their collective creativity to innovate solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Water binds all living things together in a vast and complex web of plants, animals, soils, and air. Human ingenuity has successfully supported an increasingly global network of places for production and settlement, but has not adequately addressed the indirect effects on this web. Further, the growth enabled by human technological and social advances has brought about sustainability threats like water depletion, pollution, and flooding. Communities in metropolitan areas face increased variation in water quality and supply as a result of population, land use, and climate changes, along with piecemeal and ineffective water management strategies. Meanwhile, suburban population growth increases demand for water from regional aquifers, lakes and streams, while expanding land cover intensifies the rate and severity of flooding. Local communities anticipate, prepare and cope with these problems, but often propose popular mitigation and conservation strategies that are untested or ineffective. Our approach seeks to transform water resources planning by bridging the divide between familiar simple conceptions of water problems and solutions, and a more sophisticated and practical understanding of the complexity shaping water sustainability. We embrace diversity as a resource for improved research, learning and judgment, using software to support the social and the informational processes of planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; We will design flexible and robust visualization and modeling tools representing coupled human-water systems, and examine how stakeholder groups combine them with their beliefs and values to advance water planning and policy. Building on our prior work, we will assess the robustness of existing hydrological models of the Chicago area, develop simpler and more flexible representations of these models, and couple them with land-use/cover and water-use decisions in one case study (DuPage County, Illinois). Simultaneously, we will evolve collaborative learning structures (visualization technology and facilitation strategies) to help stakeholders and policy-makers gain insight about the causal interactions between their resource use decisions and hydrology. We will study how participants use modeling and visualization in collaborative planning processes to understand and reason about the causes and effects of flooding and drought in DuPage, and to what extent they collectively engage in innovation and implementation of plans and policies that are sensitive to the complexity they face, identifying key technological and social features that better support this practice. We seek to ultimately package the computer applications and social learning process as a participatory modeling and visualization protocol for water planning that can be adopted in the Chicago region and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
