    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;em&gt;A problem adequately stated is a problem well on its way to being solved.&lt;/em&gt;” –R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; OpenAQ fosters a far-flung series of grassroots networks that fight “air inequality” by building and using the only global, real-time, and historical, open-air quality data platform in the world, aggregating data from, so far, 47 countries and more than 5,400 ground stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt;Air inequality—the unequal access to clean air to breathe—is responsible for 1 out of every 8 deaths in the world. The impact of air pollution on health and the global economy is a massive injustice to humanity. Yet, from London to Los Angeles, meaningful access to air quality data has effectively armed citizens, scientists, journalists, and whole communities to combat dirty air. Many governments, including those in severely polluted places, publicly share air quality data but often in disparate and temporary forms that make the data difficult or impossible to access for almost everyone but a tiny cadre of specialists. No government, international organization, or other group was making these data open and easily accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A global open air quality platform did not exist because: 1. It is not in the purview of a government to openly access and share another country’s data; 2. International organizations like the World Bank, the UN Environmental Program, or WHO must create formal infrastructures to access official data with each government, which there has not been a substantial push to do; and 3. Private sector organizations currently aggregating these data are not incentivized to make these data open. Therefore, a truly free, transparent, verifiable air quality platform that aggregates data from these various sources could currently only be developed by an open-source, open-data community of individuals around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air inequality often flies under the radar because, while it is a widespread, critical problem, it is one that people perceive as a local or regional issue, so it has been hard to organize national or international movements to demand action and to coordinate strategies, even though it is a nigh universal crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Through its open-source platform and rapidly growing collaborative community, OpenAQ promotes an ecosystem of air quality information that has enabled previously impossible cross disciplinary and international collaborations, scientific research projects, policy initiatives, and newly empowered, informed activism. Air pollution has enormous impacts on health and the global economy, and very poor communities often suffer the brunt of those adverse impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No government, international organization, or other group had made these data open and universally formatted prior to OpenAQ’s innovative platform. Beyond its data aggregation and sharing, OpenAQ is committed to on-the-ground convenings and has, so far, held three pilot workshops in Bosnia, India, and Mongolia to bring together journalists, scientists, software developers, artists, policymakers, and others to address air inequality. Information can’t, by itself, lead to systemic change, but widespread access to the truth about air quality accompanied by OpenAQ’s efforts to nurture dynamic and virally spreading networks, coalitions, alliances, and cross-disciplinary collaborations across regions can effectively serve as a “trim-tab” in the struggle to re-establish what should be a birthright for all humans and living creatures: healthy air to breathe.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Pollution is nothing but the resources we are not harvesting. We allow them to disperse because we&#039;ve been ignorant of their value.&lt;/em&gt;” –R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The renowned, groundbreaking, eco-conscious carpet company, Interface, wanted to source recycled material in a way that would benefit communities and the environment. The Zoological Society of London wanted to develop a model of community-based conservation that would be self-funding, empowering, and bring immediate benefits to local people. The resulting public-private partnership is Net-Works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Nature takes time to recover from human exploitation. Over-fishing has depleted fish stocks worldwide, but with so many coastal communities so dependent on fishing for their livelihoods and fleets of industrial trawlers continuing to “strip-mine” much of the high seas, there is little chance for stocks to naturally replenish. Establishing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) gives marine life a chance to recover and thrive again, but these and other conservation initiatives take a lot of time, resources, and political engagement to develop, and they have to be actively defended from poaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While communities can experience long-term benefits from such initiatives, in the short-term, conservation efforts often impose difficult costs or penalties on communities, e.g. bans on fishing that immediately affect livelihoods and income, especially for the poorest families. Traditionally, conservation has also been heavily donor-dependent. Communities often become reliant on handouts, which lock them into a destructive poverty trap. Furthermore, donors naturally want to see results quickly and may be reluctant to fund the same activities in the same place over a long period of time. This can lead to a focus on short-term fixes over more sustainable, long-term solutions that would ultimately produce much better results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Net-Works is a highly innovative program that interweaves community development, environmental protection, and closed-loop economic production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net-Works currently engages with 24 fishing communities in the Philippines and 9 in the Lake Ossa region of Cameroon who recover and then recycle discarded nylon fishing nets into yarn for use as carpet tiles. A dangerous waste product that harms marine life becomes a valuable raw material. A fair price is paid for the nets and a community-based supply chain is created. Innovative local banking initiatives, including community-managed savings and loan groups and a collective Environment Fund that invests in local conservation projects, all help to break donor dependency and make conservation self-funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net-Works is helping to restore marine life through the establishment of marine-protected areas and the replenishment of mangrove forests while strengthening local economies and enhancing community well-being and resiliency. This impressive project is now poised to expand into Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net-Works’s rapid expansion has demonstration that it is a scalable and replicable model. They have proven that it is possible to establish a community-based supply chain for waste nylon and feed it into the mainstream market. They offer communities a fair and non-inflated price for the nets, helping to turn what was once seen as waste into something of value. In this way, Net-Works has created a “circular economy” solution for a critical global problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;When individuals join in a cooperative venture, the power generated far exceeds what they could have accomplished acting individually.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; –R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; San Juan, Puerto Rico&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Fideicomiso de la Tierra del Caño Martín Peña (in English, Martín Peña Channel Community Land Trust) has designed the ENLACE project to address a variety of pressing needs in this poor, underserved, historically disenfranchised “informal” community near the center of San Juan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt;The Martín Peña Channel is an environmentally degraded 3.5-mile-long tidal channel within the San Juan Bay Estuary in Puerto Rico. Despite its privileged location in the capital, San Juan, next to the financial district, the channel is currently clogged with sediments and waste. The eight originally “informal” communities bordering the channel have a history of poverty, overcrowding, unsafe living conditions, exposure to environmental and health hazards, marginalization, blight, social invisibility, and governmental neglect. Most of the community’s 25,260 residents are descendants of impoverished peasants who migrated to the city from the early-1900s to the 1950s as the sugar cane monoculture collapsed. Migrants informally settled in lands perceived as marginal and unsafe, filling the surrounding wetlands with organic and household waste. By 2004, approximately 2,000 families living in communities along the Martín Peña Channel did not have titles or property rights to lands many had inhabited for generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environmental conditions of the Martín Peña Channel have been studied extensively, and dredging has been widely recommended, but  previous rehabilitation initiatives overlooked the symbiosis between environmental degradation and poverty. The systemic failures that gave rise to the critical needs of the communities along the channel include: governmental neglect; lack of an appropriate legal framework that fits the critical housing and land tenure needs of informal settlements; political corruption; disregard for the environment; land-value speculation; and the threat of gentrification and eviction once a community becomes more desirable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Fideicomiso de la Tierra del Caño Martín Peña (in English, Martín Peña Channel Community Land Trust) has designed the ENLACE project to address a variety of pressing needs in this poor, underserved, historically disenfranchised “informal” community near the center of San Juan. The project takes on the environmental restoration of the channel while simultaneously working to prevent gentrification and provide affordable housing and access to critical infrastructure for the inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project’s leaders decided to use a Community Land Trust (CLT) as a vehicle for community empowerment. They secured collective legal tenure of 200 contiguous acres of land in perpetuity, something truly historic and almost unheard of in such urban contexts. By tackling land rights, environmental restoration, and social justice in a multi-pronged approach, the CLT has launched an unprecedented comprehensive development model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLT has kickstarted 65 social and economic development initiatives, engaged 1,600 community youth, and successfully relocated over 600 families to allow for suitable infrastructure development. The novel application of the CLT’s collective ownership model to an informal settlement is a truly revolutionary model, already being referenced for replication by communities in Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sistema Biobolsa</title>

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;We are here as local information harvesters, local problem-solvers in support of the integrity of eternally regenerative Universe.&lt;/em&gt;” –R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Sistema.bio is a Mexican social enterprise founded in 2010, the enterprise provides comprehensive biodigester installations for small farmers to support energy independence, reduce pollution and support capacity-building. The technology enables small farmers to transform organic waste into methane gas and organic fertilizer, which increases their efficiency, productivity and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Food security, poverty, climate change and environmental degradation are the most significant challenges facing humanity. Small farmers produce over 80% of the food consumed globally and are stewards of much of the world’s arable lands, yet they are, especially in the “developing” world, among the poorest and most disenfranchised of social groups lacking access to technology, financing and capacity building to improve their productivity. This drives many of them off the land and into giant slums in the least desirable parts of urban agglomerations. Another 2 billion, mostly rural people lack access to reliable, dignified sanitation systems and waste treatment. The resulting waste creates an enormous human health and environmental burden. These poor rural communities also continue to rely on biomass fuels (such as wood collected from local forests) for their basic energy needs, driving deforestation and creating yet another devastating public health burden in the form of extremely poor indoor air quality, leading to an epidemic of serious respiratory problems, especially in women and children. As managers of households in most rural areas, women disproportionately bear the health, economic, and social brunt of these waste and energy crises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep market failures in the agricultural industry distort the technological, educational and financial opportunities available to poor farmers, and efforts to produce local staples are compromised by the crushing scale of agricultural markets, which often prioritize export crops and encourage land and wealth concentration. The macroeconomic rational of the global economy does not serve a small farmer, and a persistent myth that scale increases productivity in agricultural systems helps justify the consolidation of agricultural lands for industrial agriculture. As economic boundaries are eliminated for increased trade, cultural boundaries blur, the traditions and community cohesion that protected the land are eroded, and more and more economic exploitation of hitherto protected or sustainably managed land devastates ecosystems for short-term gain. Cultural and ecological diversity are seen as obstacles to trade and are being systematically eliminated by markets favoring specialization and enormous scale. This same rational destroys the land, pollutes waterways and spews greenhouse gases. Our overall human progress has left over 2 billion people behind, still lacking access to basic sanitation systems and forced to pillage the world’s remaining forests for fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outdated narratives must be replaced with new thinking: what was once waste must now been seen as a valuable resource. Human systems must work more like ecosystems, where the by-products from one process are the inputs for another. This is the worldview embodied, by Sistema Biobolsa, which permits farmers to convert the least appealing substances into clean energy and non-toxic, synthetic chemical-free agricultural fertility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Sistema Biobolsa provides a game-changing approach to boosting the livelihoods and well-being of small farmers (who grow 80% of the world’s food). Based on a biomimetic model that originated in the early 20th century, Sistema.bio has re-designed the common bio-digester to provide a state-of-&lt;br /&gt;
the-art, robust system with a high-quality membrane comprising modular parts. The system is compact enough to be distributable via donkeys, motorbikes, or boats. This has allowed Sistema.bio to scale and grow virally, with plans for global reach. The bio-digesters convert waste into fertilizer for agricultural application and produce natural gas for clean cooking and heating water, thereby reducing indoor air pollution and combatting deforestation. The gas is also used to run small engines for mechanical and electrical needs, providing affordable, renewable, decentralized energy to hitherto electricity-deprived populations. Sistema.bio places a heavy focus on the monitoring and evaluation of their technology. Their replication package includes technical and communication tools that allow local representatives to identify potential waste streams, calculate energy values, and track and report impacts over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sistema Biobolsa permits small farms, rural communities, and urban settlements to convert organic waste into renewable energy and organic fertilizer. Based on a biomimetic model that originated in the early-20th century, Sistema Biobolsa has re-designed the common bio-digester to provide a state-of-the-art, robust system with a high-quality membrane comprising modular parts that is compact enough to be distributable via donkeys, motorbikes, or boats. This has allowed Sistema.bio to scale to serve farmers in Colombia, India, Kenya, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Senegal and is growing virally, with plans for potentially near-global reach. The bio-digesters convert waste into fertilizer for agricultural application and produce natural gas used for clean cooking and heating water, thereby reducing indoor air pollution and combatting deforestation. The gas is also used to run small engines for mechanical and electrical needs, providing affordable, renewable, decentralized energy to hitherto electricity-deprived populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sistema Biobolsa places a heavy emphasis on the monitoring and evaluation of their technology. Their replication package includes technical and communication tools that allow local representatives to track potential waste streams, calculate energy values, order systems, and track and report impacts over time. This highly effective, multi-dimensional project also includes very flexible 0% interest loans to farmers that permit them to afford the biodigesters and recoup their investments in 12 to 18 months, making the biodigester “the best investment a farmer can ever make.” It also offers farmers in-depth training and extremely responsive technical support, and engages in the socio-cultural lives of farming families and their communities. Sistema Biobolsa is truly a game-changing approach to boosting the livelihoods and wellbeing of small farmers throughout the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE (2018):&lt;/strong&gt; To improve the affordability of the biodigester, the enterprise also provided farmers with  a unique program with a financing mechanism, pre and post sales services and long term-technical assistance. This innovative approach has been successfully replicated across diverse geographical regions, resulting into Sistema.bio expansion to  Nicaragua, Colombia, Kenya and India, while impacting more than 26,000 beneficiaries worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>KTK-BELT Vertical University Project</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2017/ktk-belt-vertical-university-project</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;[Design Science is] the effective application of the principles of science to the conscious design of our total environment in order to help make the Earth&#039;s finite resources meet the needs of all humanity without disrupting the ecological processes of the planet.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; –R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Nepal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; KTK-BELT’s Vertical University Project approaches conservation and education in Nepal, the most vertical country in the world, through the design of a “Vertical University” comprising cooperatively owned “Learning Grounds” at various altitudes in distinct ecological areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Nepal occupies only 0.09% of world’s landmass, but harbors an enormous diversity of flora and fauna due to the extreme changes in topography from the lowland Terai region to the Himalayas. Despite being one of the smallest countries in the world, it is ranked 21st on the global biodiversity index and 11th in Asia. Today, this biodiversity is facing direct threats both from the clearing of forests and from the rampant urbanization of the countryside resulting in complex socio-ecological changes, including the loss of farmland, the exacerbation of rural poverty, and growing population density in cities as former farm families crowd informal settlements on the edges of urban agglomerations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the forests dwindle and rural economies suffer, the youth population continues to swell with Nepal experiencing a demographic youth bulge: 40% of the population is between the ages of 16 and 40. Nearly 40% of Nepal’s more than 5 million young people are unemployed. Many migrate overseas to take low-paying, low-skill jobs often involving dangerous working conditions. The lack of sustainable livelihoods for youth in Nepal’s rural regions further exacerbates deforestation, land fragmentation, and illegal poaching, as young people search for ways to survive economically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the government has separately recognized the need for both conservation strategies and rural youth employment strategies, an unexplored possibility is to bridge the two by engaging rural youth in catalyzing conservation, which can in turn engender sustainable incomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; KTK-BELT’s Vertical University Project approaches conservation and education in Nepal, the most vertical country in the world, through the design of a “Vertical University” comprising cooperatively owned “Learning Grounds” at various altitudes in distinct ecological areas. Thirty-three such Learning Grounds currently serve as place-based centers for ecological education and skills development. KTK-BELT engages farmers and youth in becoming stewards of biodiversity and their unique local environments, providing livelihood opportunities through the preservation and cultivation of unique plant and animal species, such as the Himalayan soap nut and the endangered pangolin, as well as the preservation of local indigenous knowledge of the flora and fauna, of local agricultural and wild-crafting techniques, and of herbal medical traditions, such as the cultivation, production, and use of 150 unique essential oils found in one particular area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By connecting farmers and youth in the region and developing a collective ownership model for safeguarding land, KTK-BELT is addressing the threats of encroachment by developers as well as the outmigration of youth seeking economic opportunities elsewhere. One hundred-fifty farming families have pledged to retain their land for the next 7 years after coming to understand their region as a haven of biodiversity with long-term value as well as a base of opportunity for ecologically-grounded livelihoods, sustainable agriculture, and ecotourism.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Urban Death Project</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2016/urban-death-project</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Seattle, Washington, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.&lt;/em&gt;” - Buckminster Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Urban Death Project (UDP) has designed a scalable, regenerative death care model based on the natural process of decomposition. In the Recomposition centers that the UDP envisions, bodies and forest waste are composted and transformed into soil. These centers are hybrid public park, funeral home, and memorial space, with the potential to be situated in repurposed urban infrastructure. The first full-scale Recomposition center is designed to be located in the city of Seattle, Washington. The Recomposition process eliminates the need for the millions of feet of hardwood, tons of concrete, gallons of toxic embalming fluids, and land required for traditional funerary practices (burial or cremation), while giving back to the earth with nutrient compost. The Urban Death Project’s solution to today’s toxic, $20 billion funeral industry presents a new model of death care that is both human- and nature-centric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is uniquely comprehensive in that what happens to our bodies after death has enormous, universal environmental and cultural impacts. The dramatic shift from traditional burial toward cremation in the last 50 years is promising in terms of the potential for rapid cultural uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UDP’s efforts to design a new model for death care that makes the existing model obsolete is exemplary, particularly when considering magnitude of the problem they seek to solve. The work of the UDP is spurring a wider public debate about the enormous costs--both economic and environmental--of the burial industry as a whole. The UDP has done the hard spadework on the regulatory front, but future Recomposition centers will be their own legal entities. The model is meant to be adaptable and optimal for community adoption in a variety of contexts.		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The funeral industry is a broken system: economically, socially, and environmentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Modern funerary practices put an enormous strain on the environment. Conventional burial, chosen by 50% of Americans, is wasteful and toxic. Every year in U.S. cemeteries we bury 30 million board-feet of hardwood, 90,000 tons of steel, 1.6 million tons of concrete, and millions of gallons of formaldehyde-laden embalming fluid. These stave off natural decomposition, in a direct affront to natureäó»s perfect design. And beyond the tremendous waste inherent in burial is the massive amount of embodied energy from the manufacture and transport of caskets, headstones, and grave liners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, cemeteries all over the world are reaching capacity; the concept of one person owning a plot for eternity is flawed and unsustainable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, cremation rates have risen from 3% (U.S.) in 1960 to almost 50% today. But cremation destroys our potential to give back to the earth after death. It uses an energy-intensive process to turn bodies into ash, polluting and contributing to climate change. Annually, cremation emits a staggering 600 million pounds of CO2 in the U.S. alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The truth is, the last gesture that most of us will make on this earth is toxic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt;  The Urban Death Project (UDP) is joining with nature to revolutionize death care. We&#039;ve created an ecological and meaningful new option for our bodies when we die, because current funerary practices are toxic, polluting, and disconnected from the natural ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Una Hakika</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2016/una-hakika</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; The Sentinel Project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Kenya, Africa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;em&gt;If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don&#039;t bother trying to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking.&lt;/em&gt;” -R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Sentinel Project has developed Una Hakika: a hybrid of communications technology, social insight, and beneficial use of social media. The project leverages both online and offline “informational architecture” to de-escalate conflict in regions where misinformation can lead to violence or genocide. Interethnic and inter-communal violence is often dramatically exacerbated by inflammatory rumors. The Una Hakika pilot project quickly and effectively uses all available communication tools--including village councils, mobile phones, radio, print, and one-on-one conversation--to defuse conflict between the Pokomo farmers and the Orma herders in the Tana Delta of Kenya. Sentinel is now rolling out another pilot project, in Myanmar/Burma, to show that their approach can be replicated in a radically different context, halfway around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sentinel Project has committed to tackle the problem of misinformation at the largest scale, monitoring flashpoints of conflict and violence globally and then carefully crafting systems to monitor and address misinformation at the village level. Their local approach is rigorous, involving detailed socio-cultural, historical, political, and economic analyses. In situations where political parties and various stakeholders use media outlets to foment misinformation, the use of a multi-level approach - radio, phones, councils, elders, community organizing - to empower citizens to sort through rumors real-time is especially timely and globally applicable. Importantly, once the information infrastructure designed by the Sentinel Project is in place, it can be citizen-run and adapted for various audiences. The approach can also be extended for effective management of information during disaster relief efforts, political campaigns, terrorist attacks, disease outbreaks, and economic panics. During an era of growing instability, the Sentinel Project’s work in this critical domain has the potential to become a widely adopted model in many parts of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; During 2012 and 2013 violent clashes between two of the main ethnic groups in Tana Delta,Kenya, Pokomo farmers and Orma herders, resulted in the death of about 170 people and displaced as many as 40,000.One of the factors that drove the violence was misinformation. The lasting impact was fear and distrust and hatred amongst the communities in the region. Rumours continued after the violence either deliberately to stir up trouble to continue the animosity or from a misunderstanding. The lack of any local media in the area also drove rumours since there was no way to verify the rumours. This initiative seeks to address the problem of rumours in the region and in Mynmar as well as to bring peace by ensuring the communities are able to interact peacefully. The initiative also seeks to fill in the information gap in the area by being an information management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Una Hakika-an information system that monitors and counters the spread of harmful rumours and misinformation which prevents citizens from leading well-informed, secure, peaceful lives and enjoying full civic participation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;em&gt;If we do more with less, our response will be adequate to take care of everybody.&lt;/em&gt;” -R. Buckminster Fuller.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; PITCHAfrica&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Kenya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; PITCHAfrica identifies the need for water as a critical global problem, and transforms community dynamics by offering an elegantly simple solution. In a nested way, this design intervention is at once a social, educational, medical, environmental, and economic intervention. PITCHAfrica’s Waterbank Schools demonstrate that innovation is not just “reinventing the wheel”, but instead, fine-tuning it to produce a highly replicable new form that anticipates how the built environment will provide for communities in the future. In Fuller parlance, a Waterbank typology is inherently a “Design Science” solution to a global problem. The model takes a common architectural form and adds a trimtab: water catchment and filtration systems that transform the use of the structure, makes certain behaviors obsolete, and directly addresses the lack of a critical resource. Embedded in this new model is the understanding that community values are a top priority, from who builds the actual structure to its use for numerous activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The Waterbank School, whose first functioning model is a communally constructed school in Laikipia, Kenya, completed in December 2012, is a working demonstration of the remarkable leveraging power of water catchment as a socially integrated resource awareness and community engagement tool. The school’s roof harvests rainwater, directed to and stored in a central cistern that includes a ceramic filtration system. The classrooms are positioned to face in toward the rainwater-harvesting courtyard where gardens are planted to grow crops. This system serves students, faculty and the surrounding community with clean, accessible water, and the building acts as a learning tool and community training and knowledge hub for a whole region. In a world in which one billion people are living without access to clean water and water-borne illnesses are rampant, this simple design offers an elegant and practical way to address sanitation, health, and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PITCHAfrica project approaches shelter – the cornerstone of Bucky’s artifactual oeuvre – as he did: almost as a living machine. In other words, the services it “performs” are as important as what it looks like. It may not be revolutionary new design, but it reframes the design question for community centers and schools into that of creating buildings that solve problems. Waterbank Schools alleviate the problems of poverty and gender equality by transforming what is normally a woman’s burden – fetching water – into an opportunity for the whole community. Women and girls are the first tier of community members who benefit from Waterbank schools because they are the central caretakers addressing family needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the construction of Waterbank Schools, school attendance has risen by at least a quarter, and often as high as 95%, proving that proper design yields concrete impacts not only on community health and wellbeing, but also on opportunity. Waterbanks has evolved since 2007 from a design-savvy and iconic solution for capturing water into a comprehensive, school-based solution that brilliantly integrates and responds to the needs of local culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE (2018):&lt;/strong&gt; The Waterbank School building at Uaso Nyiro Primary School was named The Greenest School on Earth in 2018 by the US Green Building Council.

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;When individuals join in a cooperative venture, the power generated far exceeds what they could have accomplished acting individually.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; -R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORGANIZATION NAME:&lt;/strong&gt; Taking Root&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Nicaragua&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; CommuniTree is a simple but practical, well-executed approach to tackling three interlinked problems: deforestation, climate change, and poverty. The project ingenuously connects the dots around CO2 reduction and the generation of sustainable, local economies through a multi-faceted reforestation program. The sale of carbon credits and sustainable wood products serve as financial mechanisms to support widespread reforestation by small, stakeholder farmers in areas vulnerable to the effects of climate change in Nicaragua. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;CommuniTree tackles three interlinked problems: deforestation, climate change and poverty. Globally, deforestation and land-use change have been some of the largest contributors to climate change, biodiversity loss and other forms of environmental degradation. Our current work is in Nicaragua, where deforestation has reached a critical state, surpassing Brazil and Indonesia as the worldäó»s most depleted forest environment (Kim, Sexton and Townshend, 2015). Deforestation is the second largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, as 300 billion tons of carbon is stored in trees äóñ 40 times greater than annual greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels (Van Der Werf, G. R., 2009). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Because of lack of resources and sustainable land use planning, the main driver of deforestation in Nicaragua is the clearing of lands for cattle ranching, pastureland and subsistence agriculture. In addition to causing environmental damage, these activities only marginally improve the lives of smallholders and have not alleviated poverty. Moreover, climate change is now responsible for extreme and irregular weather events - natural disasters, soil erosion, floods, droughts and loss of arable land äóñ creating a vicious cycle that has increased the economic vulnerability of subsistence farmers, who have no other readily available means of economic survival.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Deforestation and the need for reforestation is ultimately a socioeconomic problem. People are clearing forests all over the world to make room for new agricultural activities, or new ways of earning a livelihood. When people try to address deforestation by simply planting new trees, they lack a holistic view of the problem. The multi-faceted approach to the problem is our single largest innovation. Why are people engaging in land use changes that result in deforestation? Because they need to earn a better livelihood - so we address this by linking reforestation with earning an income.&lt;/em&gt;” -Kahlil Baker, Co-Founder and Executive Director of Taking Root&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic incentive system of CommuniTree is critical in securing long-term buy-in and sustaining the attention of smallholder farmers who have little room for misallocation of time. This solution is sensitive to local needs yet tied to the global mechanism of carbon credit sales. Because of the immense acreage of degraded agricultural lands around the world, this approach has the potential to be emulated widely and to contribute greatly to global carbon sequestration, as well as to habitat restoration and poverty alleviation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;em&gt;We are called to be architects of the future, not its victims. [The challenge is] to make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time, with spontaneous cooperation and without ecological damage or disadvantage of anyone. &lt;/em&gt;”  –R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; La Montaña, Guerrero, Mexico&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; In the steep La Montaña region of Guerrero, home to 85% of that state&#039;s indigenous population and one of Mexico&#039;s most marginalized localities, landslides crippled communication and infrastructure, destroyed crops, and irreparably damaged more than 5,000 adobe homes. It is Mexico&#039;s most seismically active area, and adding insult to injury, winds there can reach 110 km/h. Cooperación Comunitaria has envisioned and is implementing a comprehensive model to radically improve these marginalized populations&#039; living conditions by working with communities to rebuild—combining sound geological and engineering risk analysis with local indigenous wisdom. The project leaders engage with local people in the placement, design, and building of affordable, seismically sound, eco-friendly, culturally appropriate dwellings using local materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;In September 2013, hurricanes Manuel and Ingrid devastated the West of Mexico, causing 200 deaths and affecting over 230,000 people. In La Montaí±a region of Guerrero state, these hurricanes caused landslides, crippled communication and infrastructure, destroyed crops, and irreparably damaged more than 5,000 adobe homes.&lt;br /&gt;
 La Montaña region, in the East of Guerrero, is home to 85% of the indigenous population of the state and is considered one of Mexico&#039;s poorest localities. Half of the Montaña&#039;s inhabitants, due to social and economic exclusion, live in extreme poverty. The region, with its steep valleys and villages perched on peaks and slopes, is particularly susceptible to landslides: it is Mexico&#039;s most seismic zone and winds reach 110 km/h.&lt;br /&gt;
 However, high-risk topography and extreme weather events are not exclusively to blame for La Montaña inhabitants&#039; vulnerability to landslides. Agrochemical overuse has deteriorated the soil, causing constant crop rotation, deforestation and thus, landslides. Moreover, extensive migration has occasioned the loss of knowledge of traditional construction methods, reducing the strength of adobe homes and increasing disaster susceptibility.&lt;br /&gt;
 Our project responds to the intensification of natural phenomena and the consequent vulnerability of marginalized populations. Our methodology for reinforcing traditional housing is replicable to other regions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The idea of working with the communities and primarily using the knowledge and the systems and techniques that each community has and has had for generations and generations makes it a very replicable model. We are not trying to put the same type of house or the same type of reforestation instituted in different regions – we are trying to combine these types of technology advances with whatever each region, both climactically and culturally, already uses. That makes it a very flexible model that can be adapted to any region of the world. It’s a model that makes use of whatever resources and knowledge a region already has.&lt;/em&gt;” - Gerson Huerta, Engineer at Cooperación Comunitaria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to their efforts in the built environment, Cooperación Comunitaria works on education and training programs, sustainable economic development through agroforestry and agro-ecological projects, as well as the revival and revitalization of local indigenous culture, including its herbal and medical traditions. Cooperación Comunitaria thus aims to address the root cause of a number of problems, all while reviving traditional skill sets and holding the collective wisdom of the community on a pedestal. This exemplary, multi-faceted initiative combines science and local traditions in a comprehensive approach community resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
