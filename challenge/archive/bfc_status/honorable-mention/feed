  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY: &lt;/strong&gt;We design and market pallet rack based housing kits which provide the urban poor and disaster relief organizations with inexpensive high density shelter &amp;amp; services. Our systems are extremely modular, can be erected and disassembled very quickly, and have a positive environmental impact on the land upon which they rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE: &lt;/strong&gt;Rapid urbanization has outpaced many cities&#039; ability to adequately accommodate the housing needs of immigrant populations. As a result a large and increasing number of people live in unhealthy conditions on disputed or government land where services are unavailable and political insecurity makes it impractical to invest in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION: &lt;/strong&gt;Taking advantage of current best practices for sustainable infrastructure we design high density, multi story, pallet rack systems and components relevant to the local conditions in which we operate. Where possible we find local vendors and use locally available materials for our components. We also train local handymen in the construction and maintenance of these systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently we have built one 3000 square foot structure on an empty lot in Bangalore. We used recycled vinyl billboards from asia to water proof the walls and roof and to create water proof furniture. We developed a rope based system which make it easy to quickly roll up or let down the walls depending on the weather. We are experimenting with wire mesh, plywood and rubber for our floors. In the coming months we will install a solar system, develop a composting toilet, design and fabricate planting boxes which can attach to the pallet racks and set up an electronics lab for designing LED lighting fixtures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Urbanology, we are finalizing plans for another project in Dharavi, Mumbai. This will serve as a &quot;&quot;social club&quot;&quot; for elderly residents and street children and will be operated by a trust and run by the residents themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cycle for Health</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2009/cycle-health</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Cycle for Health is a pedal powered catalyst that when placed into a failing rural East African transport system mobilizes medical resources, personnel and patients. The initiative capitalizes on thousands and thousands of bicycles left unused in the garages, apartment buildings and streets of North America by recycling them to rural African communities to save lives. The initiative is an immediate need for rural communities with ample medicine and skilled professionals not being delivered or accessed because of poor roads and the limited use of motorized vehicles. When advanced care is many miles away, timely diagnosis, treatment and drug delivery is critical, especially true in the case of pregnant women and HIV/AIDS, Malaria and TB patients.  In the rural setting, mild delays in initial care dominos small, treatable problems into serious ailments, resulting in a long, costly journey for advanced care at city hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To treat this rural health care problem at its root cause, Cycle for Health collects idle bicycles in North America, packages them with spare parts and tools, and ships them in purchased 40 ft. containers to community based organizations (CBOs) in rural East Africa. The fully stocked, containerized bicycle workshop becomes instant storage and workshop space upon arrival. The non-governmental organization (NGO) First African Bicycle Information Organization (FABIO), trains recipient CBO staff to repair, refurbish and remodel recycled bicycles into ambulances, goods carriers and off road transporters. The bicycle designs are marketed to hospitals, health care organizations, NGOs, and women development groups as a resource to mobilize their resources and improve their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycle for Health is a breakthrough in its comprehensive package of materials and trainings.  Where current aid programs see bicycles as a donation dropped into a needy community, Cycle for Health envisions recycled bicycles as a capital to start sustainable small scale bicycle enterprises which improve mobility of medical resources, create jobs, and enhance quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Cycle for Health organizers conducted a 2007 baseline needs assessment for bicycle use and health care delivery systems in Uganda. Community buy-in and project planning is complete for a pilot workshop in the rural Kigezi District of southwest Uganda. Technical trainings are being facilitated by FABIO and implementation is being managed by the CBO Kigezi Community Project (KCP). The two organizations have an MoU with Two Wheeled Foundation, a 501 (c)(3) which is coordinating recycled bicycle shipments, fundraising, and conducting monitoring and evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kigezi bicycle shipment departs mid-November from a collection point in Calgary for the Red Cross compound in the village of Kabale, located in the heart of the Kigezi region. During the two month travel period of the oversea shipment, KCP will establish a Cycle for Health office and schedule trainings with FABIO. The containerized bicycle workshop will be established in Kabale early 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cycle for Health three year implementation plan rolls out satellite bicycle workshops from the central “hub” in Kabale. The satellite sites double as bicycle repair points and stops on a KCP mobile health clinic route.  With empirical evidence of a Kigezi model, Cycle for Health scales out to other Ugandan and East African communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Cycle for Health operates within the ‘global village ideal’ and emphasizes treating the root cause of social problems. It presents a bold, visionary initiative backed by a solid plan and administered by a capable team of globally conscious, grassroots experienced, technically savvy organizations. It is a comprehensive package, integrating health care delivery needs with an appropriate transportation technology. The program leverages existing medical resources and empowers existing health providers rather than re-inventing the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;
Cycle for Health is ecologically responsible, promoting pedal power as a carbon-free transportation choice.                                                                                     The initiative builds on bicycle recycling programs involving North American groups and recipients in Ghana and Namibia. The impact of bicycles can be measured quantitatively and qualitatively in studying health delivery in the Kigezi region. The bicycle is an accepted and valued form of transport in rural areas, and so the concept can be adapted to a broad range of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Mukuru Biocentres</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2009/mukuru-biocentres</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Mukuru BioCentre concept is a biogas generating latrine block, managed by community groups, which can be located anywhere in a slum as it treats human waste in-situ without requiring sewerage infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Sixty percent of Nairobi’s population lives in slums characterized by inadequate housing and sanitation conditions. An average of 650 people share each toilet cubicle. The most prevalent childhood sicknesses and 40% of infant mortality are caused by inadequate sanitation. To address this, Umande Trust, a Kenyan rights-based organization, has developed the Mukuru BioCentre concept. This is a biogas generating latrine block, managed by community groups, which can be located anywhere in a slum as it treats human waste in-situ without requiring sewerage infrastructure. Umande supports communities to improve their knowledge assets and facilitates community organizing for independent action. Activities include advocacy, community financing initiatives and development of technological prototypes for urban environmental health interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Umande Trust has so far completed 12 BioCentres in Kenya. They are scattered amongst various communities and have a verifiable local impact. The Umande Trust, GOAL Ireland partnership aims to achieve a community level impact by focusing on the whole of one Nairobi settlement, Mukuru (population 185,000).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the initiative is completing a participatory urban appraisal on water, sanitation, waste management and drainage. This has highlighted inadequate sanitation as the most pressing need and recommends addressing this by:&lt;br /&gt;
•        increasing the number of affordable, sustainable,  community-managed latrine blocks&lt;br /&gt;
•        increasing the number of plot-based latrines and improving the quality of existing ones&lt;br /&gt;
•        developing a community sanitation fund as a self-propagating mechanism for scaling up the intervention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next 3 years, the project aims to reach a critical mass of 20 BioCentres which will serve 12,000 daily users. Each BioCentre will donate 10% of its profits to a community sanitation fund, and this will generate over 10,000 USD per year. This fund will be used to scale up the project through providing leverage to attract Government Decentralized Funding (government allocations to local development initiatives) to develop 2 further BioCentres each year which will then also contribute 10% of profits to the fund. The fund may alternatively support the construction and upgrading of 50 ventilation-improved plot-based latrines each year through partnership with small-scale service providers. These will have lined pits to enable them to be emptied by mobile latrine exhausters into sump tanks which will link to the city sewerage network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 BioCentres are under construction and an additional 4 are planned by mid 2009. The prize monies will be used to build a further 3 BioCentres, bringing the project closer to the critical mass needed to have verifiable impact, and to generate a community sanitation fund large enough to incrementally scale up the project to meet the level of demand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>TARA Akshar+</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2011/tara-akshar</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite several decades of programs to introduce literacy among adults, more than 50% of the women and girls in many poor countries, including India, cannot read, write or count, preventing them from participating fully in the social, economic and political processes of the modern State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TARA Akshar+ program is an initiative of the Development Alternatives Group, a social enterprise dedicated to accelerating sustainable development in the global South, particularly India. Eradication of poverty, stabilizing the climate and conserving biodiversity all need active citizen participation, which requires empowered individuals and communities, capable of acquiring the knowledge they need in a rapidly changing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the four years since DA initiated development of TARA Akshar+ it has trained more than 57,000 women to read, write and make simple calculations across 7 of the most illiterate states in India. A remarkable feature of this program is its extraordinary pass rate: more than 95%.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Water Retention Landscape of Tamera</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2012/water-retention-landscape-tamera</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Water Retention Landscape is a model for natural decentralized water management, restoration of damaged ecosystems and disaster prevention. It is a basis for reforestation, agriculture and aquaculture, especially in regions threatened by desertification, and is an integral part of a comprehensive model for sustainability in water, food, energy and social structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; The global crises of hunger, water scarcity and rapid urbanization worsen as deforestation and inappropriate agriculture degrade vast areas of land and interrupt hydrological cycles. Soil that can no longer absorb the rain is eroded, resulting in desertification, falling groundwater levels, and disastrous floods. A new approach to water management is urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The Tamera Peace Research Center in Southern Portugal is establishing a Water Retention Landscape as a model for natural water management. It is applicable across almost all the world&#039;s climate zones, providing a solution for desertification, water scarcity, flooding and rural depopulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model consists of interconnected rainwater retention spaces (or “lakes”) designed harmoniously into the landscape. The lakes are created by building earth dams, behind which rainwater is stored. The lakes are not sealed, so the water can seep into and soak the surrounding earth-body. They are built with deep and shallow zones and meandering shorelines, so the water moves constantly ensuring its vitality, oxygenation and self-purification. Terraces are built around the lakes for organic cultivation of fruit trees, vegetables and other crops, and mixed aquaculture can be established in the lakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to retain all rainwater on the land, replenish the groundwater, encourage springs to reappear, and reduce soil erosion to near zero, while supplying a community of 300 people with healthy organic produce. Five lakes have already been created across Tamera&#039;s 150 hectare (370 acre) site, and ten more are planned. The results visible so far are that natural vegetation has recovered, much wildlife has returned, a spring has reappeared, and crops can be grown on the lakeside terraces throughout the year requiring less and less artificial irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One principle of the model is to cooperate with nature&#039;s ability to provide every region of the Earth with sufficient water. In healthy ecosystems, the earth-body remains moist throughout the year, enabling the development of soil life, fertility and a diverse vegetation cover. Mixed forests with a rich topsoil are like sponges for water, integral parts of a complete water cycle in which springs, streams and clear rivers supply the whole land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second principle is that re-establishing a healthy water balance is always the first major step, on any piece of land, towards all ecological healing and sustainable economic development. A third principle is that only decentralized, socially just and beautiful solutions are truly sustainable. Our task is to correct the big mistakes of the past, in cooperation with nature, so that water, and consequently food, can once again be freely available to all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Eco-Fuel Africa</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2012/eco-fuel-africa</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine a world where Africans no longer have to cut down trees for fuel, where farmers have access to free organic fertilizers and where young girls no longer have to drop out of school! We’re making that world possible by making clean cooking energy and organic fertilizers from agricultural waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Over dependence on fuel-wood is a major cause of deforestation in Africa. As forests disappear, young girls have to drop out of school and spend long hours in the field gathering wood. African farmers also depend on some of the most depleted soils in the world and yet they are too poor to afford fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; 80 percent of Sub-Saharan Africans depend on wood for fuel. This is a major cause of deforestation. As forests disappear, many young girls in Africa are dropping out of school and spending many hours in the field gathering wood. Also, African farmers depend on some of the most depleted soils in the world and yet they are too poor to afford fertilizers. This is a major cause of malnutrition and starvation in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a solution to the above challenges, at Eco-fuel Africa we invented a sustainable method of making clean cooking energy and organic fertilizers from agricultural waste.  Our clean cooking energy cooks better, is less smoky and is cheaper than fuel-wood. Our organic fertilizers (biochar) are also environmentally friendly and help to sequester C02 by burying it in the soil where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation of our project is the two revolutionary machines that we invented. They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  A low-cost kiln which carbonizes agricultural waste. These kilns are leased to rural farmers who are taught how to use them to carbonize their agricultural waste into biochar. We then buy some of the biochar from the farmers while some is retained by the farmers and used as organic fertilizers. Already 1,000 farmers in Uganda have benefited from these kilns;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. An energy efficient briquetting machine which is used to turn the biochar into briquettes that can burn in stoves currently used for cooking in Africa.  We are already providing over 3,500 families and over 500 small-scale businesses in Uganda with clean cooking fuel using these machines;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what is unique about our project is the fact that local communities are involved at every stage of the project. Local farmers are involved as suppliers of biochar; we employ local youths to operate the machines and transport our clean cooking fuel on bicycles to our network of distributors and we also work with local women to bring our clean cooking fuel closer to users in Africa. Our project is also keeping many young girls in school and reducing the problem of indoor air pollution. But that’s not all; a portion of our income is donated to tree planting initiatives in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Beyond Benign: The Green Chemistry Commitment</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2013/beyond-benign-green-chemistry-commitment</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To have any chance of eliminating the plethora of devastating neurotoxic and carcinogenic chemicals that characterize modern life and that are doing enormous damage to human health and global ecosystems, we must radically shift the paradigms of the current and future scientists responsible for molecule and material design. John Warner, one of the two seminal founders, along with Paul Anastas, of the field of Green Chemistry, and Amy Cannon have been working assiduously to transform how chemistry is taught and practiced through their non-profit, Beyond Benign, since 1999. Their most recent project is the Green Chemistry Commitment, an initiative to get hundreds of college and university chemistry departments to commit to integrating Green Chemistry into their academic curricula. They are working with academic institutions, chemistry and materials science professors, students, government officials, and a wide range of corporations of all sizes. They have long been teaching workshops all over the country and the world to build the intellectual underpinnings of a new way of teaching chemistry. They are now seeking to get all 700 university chemistry departments in the U.S. (and then beyond) to make Green Chemistry a fundamental, integral part of any credible scientific curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pollution is disproportionately centered in disadvantaged communities at the mercy of toxic-spewing industries in their backyards. Inspired by the disinformation surrounding the 2010 BP oil disaster, Public Lab emerged to help Gulf communities undertake grassroots mapping efforts, using balloons and digital cameras to self-map over 100 miles of coastline. Their success led to a new global movement to develop affordable, community-based environmental monitoring tools, focusing on do-it-yourself, open-source tools, as well as training, education, and support, laying the groundwork for a more participatory approach to environmental justice. The Lab’s rapidly growing national and international network includes activists, educators, technologists, community organizers, residents of affected communities, hackers, hobbyists, environmental justice and conservation organizations, and institutionally-affiliated research scientists including physicists, geographers, optics and remote sensing experts, anthropologists and urban planners who contribute research, help others solve problems, build tools, and identify needs for future research via Public Lab’s online collaboration platform. Public Lab, the most effective open source tool platform we have seen, is a bold, visionary initiative that is helping empower communities around the world hold polluters accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
