  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; North Carolina, USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; bioMason “grows” durable bricks comparable in strength to calcite-cemented sandstone by using biomass, aggregate, nutrients, minerals, and bacteria to produce a natural bio-cement in less than three days in ambient temperatures, a process similar to how corals form through bio-mineralization/calcium carbonate fixation. The nutrients and minerals required are globally abundant renewable resources but may be also extracted from industrial waste streams, contributing to remediation efforts and making this mode of brick production even more ecologically beneficial. This highly promising project is an inspiring exemplar of a biomimetic strategy that finds non-polluting, benign solutions to human needs by emulating natural processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;It is estimated that over 85% of global construction uses masonry. Over 1.23 Trillion clay bricks are manufactured every year, emitting over 800 million tons of CO2 due to the fuel used in the firing process. Just from the coal consumed, the brick industry in the top five producing countries emits 1.2% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Collectively, the production of 3 billion tons of cement produced in 2009 accounted for 5% of total global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Black carbon and suspended particulate matter (SPAM) are the second-largest contributors to global warming after CO2. More than 2.4 million premature deaths can be attributed to black carbon every year.&lt;br /&gt;
 The cement industry is one of the most carbon intensive industries due in large part to the thermal energy required to produce clinker; the key component of cement. The world produced 3 billion metric tons in 2009, emitting more than 2.4 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;
 Alternative fuel sources for manufacturing both clay bricks and cement, are not enough. Measures have been explored, but still rely upon intensive demands for energy. These aging industries need a new method for making cements and binders similar to coral biomineralization.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;bioMASON bricks are composed of four primary materials: biomass, aggregate, nutrients and minerals. The biomass consists of safe, natural bacteria, which “grows&quot;&quot;— cement between grains of loose aggregate. Required nutrients and minerals are globally abundant renewable resources; but may be also extracted from industrial waste streams, contributing to remediation efforts. Wastewater can be used in the production process, saving potable water. Bacteria are added to aggregate in brick forms, and a solution containing a nitrogen source, nutrients and calcium is fed to the bricks, similar to agricultural hydroponics. The bacteria use the nitrogen source and nutrients as a source of energy, producing an environment for local calcium carbonate production. The bacterium act as nucleation sites, and mineral growth coats the aggregate grains and fills the void gaps with biocement. The resulting material exhibits physical strength properties similar to natural, calcite-cemented sandstone. This form of biocementation takes less than a few days to complete, and strength can be increased with additional time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Cooperafloresta, using both rediscovered traditional ecological knowledge and modern agricultural science, Cooperafloresta is accelerating the natural succession of flora and fauna in agriculturally degraded areas of Brazil, going further than &#039;organic agriculture&#039; and Biodynamics by using agroforestry techniques to bring major environmental and socio-economic benefits to poor rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Agriculture is a highly impactful industry today, using 80% of available fresh water, causing soil erosion, pollution and contamination of food, soil and water, also converting forests into agricultural land and so increasing deforestation, causing loss in biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, and is one of the main causes of Greenhouse Gases emissions. The ecological agroforestry method is a viable alternative to harmonize agriculture with preserving our environment, recovering forest structure, dynamics and biodiversity, generating a wide range of products with high productivity. Combining agriculture and restoration of the natural environment, is a central issue if we are to properly supply water and food globally, contributing greatly to resolve the antagonism between food production, forest and water availability, with repercussions that go far beyond local and regional context. Sucessional Agroforestry Systems (SAF) can produce food in abundance and simultaneously accelerate the process of regenerating forest life. SAF demonstrates the ability to break with the negative impacts of modern agriculture. The path followed by this revolutionary form of agriculture points to a comprehensive view of sustainability, autonomy and sovereignty of rural communities across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The actions of Cooperafloresta developed among 300 family farmers in Brazil, who manage over 1,000 ha of SAFs.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located in the Ribeira Valley, Brazil and initiated 17 years ago, Cooperafloresta (Cooperative of Agricultural Farmers of Barra do Turvo and Adrianópolis), built a new socio-economic-environmental perspective together with impoverished communities, combining traditional knowledge with technical and scientific knowhow, building a holistic system, and so exercising sustainability. These strategies and concepts take a new look at notions of efficiency and rationality, questioning the Cartesian logic and patterns of agricultural production and consumption of modern day society.                                                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of the Gaia Theory, agroforestry is a breakthrough in the practical sense of people and agriculture re-joining Nature. It is trying to understand and use the processes of natural succession, the relationships between species and the natural cycles to produce healthy foods, allowing thus increasing biodiversity and environmental conservation.&lt;br /&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                     The trajectory of this experiment is very successful, expanding from 3 to 300 families, involved and has increased from an area of 2ha to 1.000ha of SAFs. The positive impacts are numerous: soil, water, fauna and flora recovered and protected; avoiding emissions of GHGs and actually fixing carbon in to the soil; increased diversified production of food, timber, medicinal herbs; higher per family average annual income from $ 500.00 to U.S. $ 6,000.00 through the alternative and solidary markets; Recovery of traditional knowledge, cultural and integral dimension of local communities, strengthening their social organization, and developing partnerships and networks; positive impact in public policies.&lt;br /&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                     This project has touched, inspired and trained thousands of people in Brazil through the School of Agroforestry, an informal space and technical skills training facility in agroforestry, where students learn from the socialization experience of Cooperafloresta. Our larger mission is to implement Agroforestry throughout the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Olazul</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2013/olazul</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Olazul, a non-profit organization working to improve coastal community livelihoods in developing countries, is developing a more sustainable model of shrimp farming, and contributing to the restoration of ocean ecosystems as well as increasing support for marine conservation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Though small in stature, a shrimp can have a big ecological footprint. Bottom trawling for wild shrimp disturbs benthic habitat and captures six pounds of unwanted bycatch, including sea turtles and sharks, for every pound of shrimp. Onshore shrimp ponds uproot mangroves, which serve as nurseries for wild shrimp, and release toxic chemicals and non-native shrimp into sensitive waterways. Both methods are extremely carbon intensive.&lt;br /&gt;
Once deemed the Gulf of California’s pink gold, shrimp has lost its luster. Fishermen spend more time and money on fuel to catch less. Disillusioned youth are leaving their communities for lack of economic opportunities. They want to help fisheries rebound but cannot support any restrictions on fishing in the absence of viable economic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating shrimp is not inherently unsustainable; rather, shrimp are detritivores and one of the only high-value seafood products to occupy a low rung on the food web. Olazul draws on principles of ecological aquaculture and the lessons of sustainable agriculture to design a production system for native shrimp that utilizes – and further cultivates – the abundant nutrients available in the open ocean. Our model can generate long-term economic benefits and a window of opportunity for ecological restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Olazul is a non-profit organization innovating coastal livelihoods that restore ocean ecosystems. Beau Perry witnessed the devastating effect of collapsing fisheries and unsustainable shrimp aquaculture on coastal communities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. He knew that marine protected areas could help stocks rebound but understood fishermen would not support these initiatives while they struggled to feed their families. Once he graduated from business school, Beau founded Olazul to work on a win-win solution. He recognized offshore aquaculture as an opportunity to get it right from the start: to create community-based businesses that provide steady income to fishing communities and take the pressure off overfished ecosystems. Beau convened an expert advisory team, developed a plan, and raised funds for Olazul’s research site in La Paz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olazul envisions vibrant coastal communities working to support healthy marine ecosystems. Our community-based, science-driven innovation process relies on trained local staff (including current and former fishermen with skills learned in training onsite). In 2012, the hatchery team sourced broodstock for native brown shrimp and began to experiment with rearing shrimp post-larvae using probiotics instead of using antibiotics and other harmful chemicals commonly applied as treatments in shrimp hatcheries. We obtained mariculture research concession near La Paz, obtained all the necessary government permits, deployed two Aquapods and stocked the first cohort of shrimp in September with 99% survivorship. We implemented a no-feed regime in the Aquapods to determine feasibility of this approach and three months later, more than 90% of these shrimp continued to survive, which demonstrated that it is possible to cultivate organic shrimp in open ocean pens without artificial feed inputs. We extended the experiment to determine the long-term carrying capacity of the system and are now developing a protocol for importing enhanced natural productivity (i.e., algae, copepods, etc.) into the containment system to improve growth rates.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ento</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2013/ento-0</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Ento is introducing insects to the Western diet. As agricultural productivity cannot keep up with global food demands, edible insects potentially have positive environmental benefits globally as well as on human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Global food demand is accelerating and agricultural productivity cannot keep up. By 2050 food demand is set to double. Much of this increase in demand will be for meat, which has a huge environmental impact. The livestock industry accounts for 70% of agricultural land use, and 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions. If we are to achieve global food security, it is critical that we diversify our food systems with more ecologically responsible options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edible insects offer this alternative. They are much more space and energy efficient than traditional livestock, and produce far less greenhouse gas. They are also highly efficient at turning feed into protein. Compared to beef, grasshoppers create 9 times more meat for the same amount of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the West, the ‘meat-sweet’ diet, has also created an obesity epidemic. A 200gram serving of minced beef is 50% fat by weight. Insects in contrast are an excellent, low-fat source of protein, and are rich in vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, although insects are enjoyed by billions of people around the world, they are taboo in the Western diet. This is the challenge that Ento aims to tackle, by introducing delicious foods, great products, and exciting eating experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Ento is a food brand based in London. Our vision is for edible insect foods to become an enjoyable everyday reality in the West. We intend to achieve this through a series of delicious products and eating experiences that will gently challenge the social taboo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founding team was inspired by research from Wageningen University which showed the amazing potential of insects as a new source of food. However, our team noticed that no one had yet tackled the challenge of how insects might become accepted.  As Design Masters Students at the Royal College of Art, we decided to use design thinking and user research to develop a system for introducing edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team studied other food introductions (like Sushi), researched food cultures, and performed food experiments with users. We used our findings to develop our brand ‘Ento’. Ento challenges people’s negative preconceptions of eating insects and repositions them as a fun, modern, and healthy food source. We also created a range of delicious insect dishes and developed a strategic roadmap for their introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since graduating our team has been working to make Ento a reality, by turning our strategic roadmap into an actionable business plan. Our plan for Ento as a company is to focus on the consumer acceptance challenge through food service and food products. We also intend to work closely with farms to grow the supply of responsibly grown edible insects in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working with chefs and food designers to refine our recipes, and have begun catering small events to test our products. We believe the next 3 years are critical for our brand and the introduction of insects as a new food. We want Ento to challenge the social taboo and to get people thinking differently about insects as a new ingredient. And although insects in the supermarket might seem like a far off possibility, we believe it may be closer than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>MASS Design Lab</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2013/mass-design-lab</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; MASS Design Lab is a research project of MASS Design Group, exploring the integration of public health, economic development, environmental performance and education into a comprehensive formalized architectural strategy through a rigorous assessment process and immersive community component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Design and public health operate in near-isolation and yet the consequences of both are inextricably linked. In 2010, over 250,000 people in Haiti were killed when one earthquake leveled buildings and devastated infrastructure. Three years later, Port-au-Prince remains vulnerable to disease as a result of a failed built environment. In Rwanda, the built environment contributes to high infant mortality rates and hospitals that spread disease. This toll is not unique to the developing world. The American Medical Association estimates that 80,000 people die annually due to hospital acquired infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating health considerations with building design is critical to resolving these devastating societal issues, but the research and social capital required is fiscally unachievable using current modes of practice. Buildings in the developing world are largely designed in isolation from the communities they serve. Often, local construction processes and materials are ignored and replaced by building systems with little cultural or economic relevance, perpetuating a systematic reliance on aid. MDLab develops a better built environment by implementing a practice based on investment in anticipatory social capacity that performs under crisis and change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Since 2008, MASS has developed significant immersive expertise through the design and construction of buildings, products, and policy in 7 countries. MASS has realized that architectural design in isolation cannot foster systematic improvement without an investment in research and training. MDLab embodies a practice that, through the development and dissemination of knowledge, leverages the potential of design to enable social innovation to respond to today’s greatest challenges.                     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, MDLab has identified four initiatives to be pursued during a three-year development phase:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Quantitative building assessment in the context of health, environment, and economy;&lt;br /&gt;
2) Development of policy initiatives for improved guidelines for safer buildings that exhibit better performance;&lt;br /&gt;
3) Use of local materials and innovative building technologies;&lt;br /&gt;
4) Dissemination of new knowledge through advocacy and education.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on knowledge gained through systematic research, MDLab conducts training programs to build internal capacity within MASS as well as expand the possibility of economic and social development through field workshops to engage communities and foster academic partnerships globally. Initially, research/training centers will be established in Rwanda and Haiti to begin prototyping processes for global application. For example, in Butaro, Rwanda a rural housing initiative has been launched as a communal effort, serving immediate needs and fostering growth through skill building in safe construction practices. This housing initiative creates means for collaborative exchange between local workers, students from the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), and universities worldwide. The research – training – design – construction workflow will link social and health outcomes with design, and generate a replicable feedback loop for global change. Additionally, the research conducted at the Butaro-based building lab will serve as small-scale tests for building technologies that can be translated to large-scale infrastructural buildings throughout Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Fundacion Paraguaya</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2013/fundacion-paraguaya</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Fundacion Paraguaya aims to eliminate poverty in Paraguay using a bottom up strategy that combines granular analysis and data collection, grassroots financing, precise targeting of services, and coordination on a national anti-poverty effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the world’s poor are micro-entrepreneurs or their dependents depending for survival on income from precarious, informal businesses. Too often their attempts to increase income and get out of poverty are derailed by many other poverty-related problems: lack of decent housing, clean water, health care, skills, networks, etc. This is not only a personal tragedy for the 1.4 billion living in extreme poverty and billions more who are “merely” poor; poverty puts the whole global system at risk. Without a sustainable, replicable solution to poverty, the world faces increasing over-population, deforestation, pollution of watersheds and other strains on natural resources, which all life on earth requires to sustain itself.  By allowing global poverty to continue, the world deprives itself of the talents and resources of billions of people who could contribute their energy and intelligence to solve global problems. Our solution-- The Traffic Light Poverty Elimination Strategy-- is based on market mechanisms so as to be sustainable and replicable, but considers poverty holistically in 50 dimensions, which include only insufficient income but also poverty’s effects on individuals, including low self-esteem, resignation to poverty, lack of participation in the political system, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite decades of top-down programs to alleviate poverty, 1.4 billion live in extreme poverty. The “Traffic Light” strategy eliminates poverty from the bottom up, enabling the poor to be the architects of and chief protagonists in their own plans for overcoming poverty as it affects their families in 50 dimensions. &quot;&quot;The “traffic light” strategy begins with a survey of each village banking client consisting of 50 questions on 50 different aspects of poverty in 6 categories: income&amp;amp;employment; health&amp;amp;environment; housing&amp;amp;infrastructure; education&amp;amp;culture; social organization&amp;amp;civic participation; and self-awareness&amp;amp;personal motivation. Each question has 3 possible answers represented by 3 pictures showing how a typical family would fare on conditions of extreme poverty, poverty and non-poverty. For each question, the client identifies the picture which best depicts her family’s situation. A village bank advisor records this data on her PDA and downloads it into FP’s data base. This becomes the baseline for measuring client’s progress in overcoming poverty.&lt;br /&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                      The client receives a page showing in “traffic light” format the ways in which her family is “extremely poor” (red), “poor” (yellow) &amp;amp; “not poor” (green).  She uses this “traffic light” to prioritize poverty-related problems her family needs to resolve and, with help from her advisor, develops her family poverty elimination plan. The village bank gets a group “traffic light” highlighting problems that lend to group solutions and members who could be role models. Then, with FP lending and training, government services targeted to specific family needs, collaboration from specialized NGOs and the private sector, and a pro-active stance by village bank members, families tackle poverty-related problems one-by-one, until their “traffic lights” are completely “green,” showing they are no longer poor in any of the 50 dimensions.&lt;br /&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                Inspiration for this strategy came from FP’s 25 years in microfinance. We learned that financial inclusion, while crucial, is not enough to overcome poverty, and that clients are our greatest resource.  Since 2008, we have tested our idea in pilots of increasing size and complexity; now we are using the strategy with 37,300 village banking clients and looking to export our idea.  Our vision is a world free of poverty, where all families have the tools and support to overcome poverty in all its dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>100,000 Homes Campaign</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2013/100000-homes-campaign</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; 100,000 Homes Campaign, an ambitious campaign to spark a &quot;&quot;national movement to house America&#039;s most vulnerable homeless people&quot;&quot; by reframing the issue as a health crisis and transcending entrenched mindsets to figure out how to effectively collaborate and how best to allocate existing financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; For most, homelessness is a short-term crisis, but for a small subset of roughly 100,000 people, it becomes a chronic condition. These individuals and families have extremely complex health and social needs that prolong their homelessness. They also draw on costly government services that fail to deliver lasting or cost effective results. Research suggests that targeting these individuals for permanent housing saves money and lives; and yet, many communities across the country are stuck in an entrenched first-come, first-served model that screens out the most costly and vulnerable as undeserving or impossible to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 100,000 Homes Campaign is a growing movement to do things differently. By framing homelessness as an urgent public health crisis, the Campaign has mobilized 189 communities to adopt good design thinking as a way of rapidly transforming the way their local public systems approach the issue.  Through a strong Collective Impact approach at the local and national levels, we have knit together multiple sectors, bringing design thinking and Quality Improvement principles to a field (homelessness) where they were never before applied. These practices and transparent data feedback loops allow communities to maximize use of existing resources to house people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; The 100,000 Homes Campaign, coordinated by Community Solutions, is a national movement of communities finding permanent housing for 100,000 homeless Americans by July 2014. The Campaign draws on public health and design strategies to help communities do more with less, ending homelessness in measurable, efficient, and cost-effective ways.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Voltree Acoustic Early Detection Sensor System</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2013/voltree-acoustic-early-detection-sensor-system</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; Voltree Acoustic Early Detection Sensor System harvests power from a living tree to convert its chemical activity into small amounts of electric current and to &#039;read&#039; its levels of dehydration, disease, fire risk, even potential seismic activity and CO2 levels, anticipating emerging challenges in agriculture and forestry in order to prevent such things as insect infestations and fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Many species of insects that threaten valuable plant species are hard to detect in the early stages of infestation. Some of these species have a severe impact on the ecological balance of sensitive areas and also on the agricultural resources of many areas of the world. Some examples are the Asian Long Horned Beetle, the Red Palm Beetle, the Australian Cane Grub and the Southern Green Stink Bug. These types of infestations may become more severe as a result of global warming as their habitation regions change. There is a need to provide early detection of these pests that can be used in the United States and large areas of the developing world. Detection of an infestation in the early stages will allow the use of an environmentally safe remediation approach instead of massive use of environmentally dangerous chemical pesticides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; We propose a system that will provide early detection of insect pests that threaten valuable crops and tree species. Insects of interest include the Asian Long Horned Beetle and the Red Palm Beetle. The system allows early detection using the sounds of the larvae while they are feeding on plants.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Green Chemistry Commitment</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2013/green-chemistry-commitment</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; The Green Chemistry Commitment, an initiative to get university chemistry departments to commit to integrating Green Chemistry into their academic curricula and transform how chemistry is taught and practiced in order to eliminate the numerous devastating neurotoxic and carcinogenic chemicals that characterize modern life and damage the global ecosystem, replacing them with non-toxic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; Why are there hazardous industrial chemicals in our commercial products? One reason is because the people who design molecules receive little or no training in how to design them safely when they are students. This initiative seeks to make fundamental systematic change in the way we train our future scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Our initiative seeks to have College and University Chemistry departments commit to integrate Green Chemistry into their academic curriculum. The Nonprofit Organization Beyond Benign serves as central hub of this initiative. Over the past two years a steering committee from 9 universities has shaped this program. People directly impacted are chemistry and materials science undergraduate students destined to design the molecules in future commercial products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for this program stems from John Warner’s personal experience. John achieved success as a research scientist early in his career. He received several awards as a student in Chemistry, being named one of Boston’s “Best and Brightest” college graduates in 1984.  While working in exploratory research at the Polaroid Corporation he made several inventions leading to numerous patents.  While at Polaroid, Paul Anastas, who was working at the US EPA, co-authored the defining text for the field of green chemistry and wrote its “twelve principles”.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly in the middle of his sky-rocketing career, Warner tragically lost his two year old son to a birth defect of unknown origin. This caused him to question the classes that he had taken as a chemistry student. He realized that he had never had any course work that taught mechanistic toxicology or mechanisms of environmental harm. Upon further research he found that no colleges or universities require students in chemistry to take any such classes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because no chemistry faculty member is likely to have ever had these classes, who can teach them and what will they teach? Beyond Benign has been helping to develop a wide variety of curricula and educational materials appropriate for a wide variety of classroom environments with diverse cultural backgrounds. While achieving a truly sustainable future is complex, one critical important first step is to ensure that designers and inventors of our built world have at least some fundamental training on what actually causes the negative impacts of chemicals on human health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>TBS River Regeneration</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2013/tbs-river-regeneration</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt; TBS River Regeneration works to restore river systems and local rural economies in India by drawing from ancient water wisdom, empowering local communities to build small traditional rainwater harvesting structures (johads) as well as by developing local and national awareness and education programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEM SPACE:&lt;/strong&gt; No being can live without water. A thirsty being will flee miles to quench its thirst or die in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the most critical global resource challenge that is facing the globe is the shrinking pool of available fresh water. The desertification of landscapes and pollution of fresh water sources displace large numbers of people and animals, creating pressure on the areas they flee to. Growing demands for water for drinking, household needs, agriculture and for waste management when unsatisfied, lead to the breakdown of community and result in conflict between neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our solution harnesses the traditional wisdom of communities to design and build small rain-water harvesting interventions at strategic places, facilitating the recharge of groundwater supplies and subsequently of river systems. This in turn rebuilds ecosystems along the river course and strengthens the resilience of communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These interventions in India, (Image 3), restore a feature of ‘natural design’ which our ancestors had identified and maintained over thousands of years, to secure their water supplies. In the pursuit of hi-tech solutions to eliminate droughts in the 20th century this ancient wisdom had been forgotten the world over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION:&lt;/strong&gt;  TBS mobilises the traditional wisdom of decentralised communities in arid areas to address local water shortages. As rivers systems are restored, their degraded ecosystems (human, natural, social, ecological, economic, political) revive. Long term, economic and food security becomes secured through the engagement and empowerment of all community members. &lt;/p&gt;
