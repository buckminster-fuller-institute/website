<tr><td><h2>Summer Installations and projects by BFI&#8217;s Prototype Program:</h2>
<img src="trashu.jpg" width="500" height="375" border="0" alt="tensegrity"><br /><br />
On July 19th, Prototype volunteers led a workshop at <a href="http://www.sculpture-center.org/exhibitionsExhibition.htm?id=11909"> The Sculpture Center</a> in Long Island City, New York in the exploration of DIY Tensegrity structures. Using commonly discarded materials such as old bicycle tire tubes and pvc piping, participants spent the afternoon studying various Tensegrity patterns before creating our own creation; a Tensegrity wall from octahedral modules. The event, entitled &#8220;Doing More with Mess&#8221; was a put on in conjunction with the current exhibition, <a href="http://www.universityoftrash.org/"> The University of Trash</a>, a project by Michael Cataloi and Nils Norman.<br /><br />
<img src="figment.jpg" width="500" height="375" border="0" alt="figment"><br /><br />
BFI joined with hundreds of organizations and individuals that helped transform NYC&#8217;s Governors Island into an annual celebration of participatory art and culture where anything is possible, a weekend long event known as <a href="http://figmentnyc.org/2009/">Figment*</a>. Our installation re-purposed discarded plastic containers bearing the recycling number 5 (a non recyclable material under current NYC sanitation guidelines) in a closest packing arrangement to form a spherical structure. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26050350@N04/sets/72157619965223734/">See more photos of ‘Prototype 5’ here</a>.<br /><br />
<img src="flyny.jpg" width="450" height="300" border="0" alt="flyny"><br /><br />
In May, Prototype entered <a href="http://flyny.org/">Fly NY 2009</a> a first annual international kite design competition sponsored by the New York City Parks Department.  Entering with a large tetrahedral kite constructed from wooden dowels and postal envelopes, the BFI team attracted much attention, a small amount of hang time, and received a runner-up award. All participating kites were auctioned off, with proceeds going to support Architecture for Humanity. <a href="http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20090722/fearless-flying"> Read the Metropolis Magazine article about the event here.</a><br /><br />
The Prototype Program involves local participants in a collaborative and tactile learning mission; experimentation with structure. The program is open to the public and we invite all curious individuals to lend a hand or contribute an idea to the development and realization of our projects.

<tr><td><h1>TRENDS & PERSPECTIVES</h1><h2>The Summer Of Algae</h2><img src="algae.jpg" width="359" height="239" border="0" alt="Algae"><br /><br /> All of a sudden, the sun is shining on early-stage companies developing algae-based fuel. Call it the summer of algae.<br /><br /> Oil giant ExxonMobil&#8217;s commitment to invest $600 million in research and development alongside venture-backed Synthetic Genomics Inc. is just another in a string of recent announcements of either new fund-raises or strategic partnership with established companies.<br /><br /> In late June, start-up Algenol Biofuels Inc. formed a partnership with The Dow Chemical Co. to develop a $50 million, algae-to-fuel pilot-scale plant employing Algenol&#8217;s technology, which involves linking the production of sugar from photosynthesis with the enzymes required to produce ethanol within an individual blue-green algae cell. (Source: <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2009/07/14/the-summer-of-algae/" target="_blank">WSJ</a>)<br /><br />Related:<br />&raquo; <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/23039/">Big Oil Turns To Algae</a><br />&raquo; <a href="http://www.upi.com/Energy_Resources/2009/07/16/Algae-get-Exxons-big-biofuel-bet/UPI-36761247761557/">Algae get Exxons Big Biofuel Bet</a> <br /></td></tr><tr><td><h2>City Bees Are All the Buzz</h2><img src="bees.jpg" width="380" height="253" border="0" alt="city_bees"><br /><br />Honeybees may not be the first thing that come to mind when you think of Brooklyn. Yet here is Yeshwant Chitalkar, high on a rooftop in the Red Hook section of the New York borough, opening a bright blue hive to check on its queen. The vista is a mix of parks, light industrial areas, and housing projects. Dr. Chitalkar works methodically, barehanded, carefully lifting out the hive’s frames, which are covered in a velvety, undulating layer of bees.<br /><br /> He is one of a growing number of urbanites who keep bees in cities across the country. Their motivations vary: Some are worried about the environmental impact of fewer bees to pollinate food crops. And some are urban gardeners who want to make their gardens more productive. Others say beekeeping is a way to connect with nature even in the heart of the concrete jungle.<br /><br /> Oh, and there is the honey, too. Counterintuitive as it might seem, urban hives are generally as productive and healthy as rural ones. In a good year, one hive can produce up to 200 pounds of honey.

<tr><td><h1>RESOURCES</h1><h2>Build a Geodesic Dome Solar Greenhouse to Grow Your Own Food</h2><img src="greenhousedome.jpg" width="500" height="375" border="0" alt="dome"><br /><br />What do you do when you want to grow your own food, but live more than a mile above sea level in Colorado? That is the question my dad wanted to answer when he started this project about a year ago: Living at 7,750 feet above sea level, with a summer growing season of about 80 days between killing freezes, how can you grow your own food?

Buckminster Fuller</h2><img src="newviews.jpg" width="200" height="286" border="0" alt="newviews"><br /><br />A serious scholarly look at the work of R. Buckminster Fuller is long overdue. While Fuller himself wrote and published many volumes, and several biographies were written about him, there is little research that contributes to a critical understanding of his work and its historical significance. The 1,300-plus linear feet of material contained in the Fuller Archive at Stanford, including papers, photographs, audio and video recordings, and models, has been recently organized and described by the Department of Special Collections, and is ready to be explored by a new generation of scholars. This volume, edited by Hsiao-Yun Chu and Roberto G. Trujillo, discusses Fuller and his work in the context of larger social and cultural patterns.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=9084">Read more about this recent Stanford University Press publication</a>.<br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td><h2>Artist Olafur Eliasson Interviewed by the Architects Newspaper</h2><img src="olafur.jpg" width="430" height="322" border="0" alt="ch4"><br /><br />The work and ideas of Buckminster Fuller have been an important touchstone for many of today&#8217;s architects, designers, and artists. In her essay for the Whitney Museum&#8217;s publication that accompanied the recent Fuller exhibition, Elizabeth Smith, chief curator at Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA), traced these influences on a current generation, including Danish-born artist Olafur Eliasson. With major exhibitions on both Fuller and Eliasson now on view at the MCA, AN asked Smith to discuss Fuller&#8217;s continued relevance, interest, and significance with Eliasson. <a href="http://archpaper.com/e-board_rev.asp?News_ID=3603">Read the full interview here.</a><br /></td></tr>
