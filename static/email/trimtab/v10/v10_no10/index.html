<h2>Guy Nordenson interview in October 2009 issue of The Believer</h2><img src="believer.jpg" width="229" height="272"><br /><br />Reknowned structural engineer Guy Nordenson discusses the relationship between engineering, architecture and sustainability, mega-projects past, current, and future and his relationship with Buckminster Fuller. Excerpt:<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting to ask why Bucky now? I think it follows an anthology put out by Lars Muller called <i>Your Private Sky</i>. What the book did was to dig through the archive and highlight the side of Bucky that was the artist, his drawings in particular, the cartoon-like sketches of the 4D House and the ways in which a helicopter could install it. There was an energy in those drawings which I think surprises many people. The artist side as opposed to the intellectual side of Bucky is coming out.&#8220;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200910/?read=interview_nordenson">Visit The Believer website to read more!</a><br /><br />

<tr><td><h2>Metropolis interview with 2009 Challenge winner team leader Ryan Chin</h2><img src="chin.jpg" width="500" height="363"><br /><br />When I first saw computer renderings of the MIT Smart Cities research group&#8217;s CityCar a few years ago, I thought I was looking at a pie in the sky vision of a distant (and idealized) future. This compact, stackable electric vehicle is supposed to dock at charging stations throughout a city, allowing lucky urban dwellers to simply swipe a card for an instant, on-the-go rental. But it turns out that a system like this, dubbed Mobility on Demand by the MIT researchers, could become a reality in the tantalizingly near future. The Smart Cities team has already developed three concept vehicles, including the CityCar, it&#8217;s currently working with General Motors on a drivable model, and it has an initial pilot program, using an electric bicycle, tentatively lined up for Boston next summer. Ryan Chin, a PhD candidate in the Smart Cities group, predicts that a full-fledged system will happen within the next five years. (A $100,000 prize awarded by the Buckminster Fuller Institute last June should help here.) Recently, I spoke to Chin about the principles of Mobility on Demand, his team&#8217;s fleet of lightweight electric vehicles, and the differences between car development in Cambridge and Detroit.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20091027/mobility-on-demandand-in-the-near-future">Read the entire interview on the Metropolis website here.</a><br /><br /></td></tr>
<tr><td><h2>Radical Green</h2><img src="jtodd.jpg" height="333" width="500"><br /><br />The Omega Center for Sustainable Living is a pretty little building tucked into the calm green exile of Rhinebeck, New York, 100 miles north of Manhattan. Pass into the main room and a long southern exposure throws a halo of light over ponds burbling amid overgrown elephant ears, callalily buds, and banana trees. Just yonder, four outdoor pools descend gently down a hill, their reeds and bulrush stalks fairly singing with a late summer breeze. The building is the newest addition to the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies, a nonprofit that is every bit as New Age as it sounds and where shapeshifting courses and &#8220;bootcamp for goddesses&#8221; do the work of its sunny mission: &#8220;awakening the best in the human spirit.&#8221; Hover over the pools too long, though, and one&#8217;s treated to an awakening of an entirely different sort. Issuing from those murky depths is a faint sour odor, unmistakable to anyone who&#8217;s ever walked past a sewer grate. The center is a living, breathing shrine to shit. It also happens to be one of the greenest buildings in America. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20091021/radical-green">Continue reading on metropolismag.com</a><br /><br /></td></tr>
