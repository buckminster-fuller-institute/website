Using a space-frame structure (Fuller&#8217;s Octet Truss) - Prototype constructed a 10 frequency tetrahedron (picured above, left) with one truncated vertex (in reference to the flat tops of the Mayan pyramids). Translucent plastic pieces were scarcely distributed amongst the hundreds of recycled cardboard components that comprised the bulk of the structure to allow the fluorescent light generated from within to illuminate outside. The installation was funded by Mangusta & LAFCO Productions.<br /><br />New York based fashion designer <a href="http://www.lauradawson.com/">Laura Dawson</a> invited Prototype to create a geodesic-dome inspired architectural installation (pictured above, right) that would serve as both dressing/makeup room, and fashion show centerpiece for the unveiling of Dawson&#8217;s spring collection during New York&#8217;s 2009 Fashion Week. Through experimentation with network programming, Prototype participant Matt Howard attempted to liberate Fuller&#8217;s structural lattices from their platonic solids and reinterpret the struts on dome structures as social connections, molded by forces from physical and behavioral simulations. Fabricated from machine cut triangles of corrugated plastic, the structure was assembled and installed  by Prototype participants. The installation was funded by Red Bull.<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.nypost.com/fashion/buzz/archives/2009/02/backstage_with.html">Watch a video from backstage</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><h2>New Dymaxion Fold-Up Globes available in our online store</h2><img src="foldup.jpg" width="500" height="231" border="0" alt="grunch"><br /><br />A new version of the Dymaxion Fold-Up Globe is now available.  This version is based on Fuller&#8217;s popular Air/Ocean Dymaxion map which presents the world&#8217;s temperature zones shaded in attractive colors with updated city names.

The most recent climate change science from NASA tells us that we must stabilise our carbon dioxide emissions at 350 parts per million, a figure we have already overshot with emissions currently standing at 385 parts per million. The joint challenges facing us are of the widespread adoption of low carbon energy sources and the implementation of resource and requirement-appropriate electricity grids.  Business as usual is simply no longer an option.<br /><br />For Europe, that means some major changes ahead: of the way we generate electricity, new customer requirements, new technology opportunities.  We fundamentally need to change our ageing transmission grids and electricity networks to embrace a trans-national smart grid able to accommodate clean energy sourced from geographically wide ranging locations from the likes of wind in Northern Europe and concentrating solar power farms in the Sahara.  Some of this power will be from intermittent sources (wind), some not (heat storage can be used for CSP)  and some power may go the opposite way through the grid. This is contrary to the situation at present, where the flow is largely unidirectional - from the power station down to the user. <br /><br />A growing consensus is gaining momentum at Brussels level that in addition to adoption of large scale low carbon energy resources, home generated electricity from microgeneration will also become the norm, with surplus sold to the grid.  Other demands on the grid will evolve, such as the use of electric cars that will be plugged in overnight to recharge. Our grids will need to accommodate these varied, complex and fluctuating loads.

The world could try to develop a new model from first principles, but Princeton&#8217;s Simon Levin, the Scripps Institute&#8217;s George Sugihara, and Oxford&#8217;s Bob May have published work pointing out that there are many natural systems that mimic, in nontrivial ways, the functioning of financial markets. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come to understand,&#8221; says Levin, &#8220;that they&#8217;re the same kinds of systems.&#8221; Both feature competition for limited resources; individuals trying to maximize their own return; and competition and exploitation as well as the need for cooperation.<br /><br />Moreover, Levin and his colleagues argued in a 2006 report for the National Academies of Science and again in a 2008 commentary in Nature that the long history of natural systems is strong evidence of those systems&#8217; resilience against major shocks. For instance, some features, such as predator-prey ratios, have remained stable over hundreds of millions of years. The challenge is to engineer financial markets that are similarly robust.<br /><br />Levin is hesitant to appropriate any model, in toto, from one system and indiscriminately apply it to another; an ecology and an economy will never be perfectly analogous. Rather, he says, researchers should try to find the shared principles that govern the behavior of each.<br /><br />Economies and ecosystems are what Levin calls complex adaptive systems, ones, he says, &#8220;that are made up of lots of individual agents that act together in smaller scales.&#8221; The collective consequences of those actions exhibit the hallmark features of complexity. A key feature of complex adap tive systems is that they can settle into a number of stable equilibria: The tech bubble of the 1990s was one such state, but so was the Great Depression. Similarly, in ecosystems, it is natural for species to go extinct; so too is it for corporations.

The U.S. car-centered transportation model, with three cars for every four people, that much of the world aspires to will not likely be viable over the long term even for the United States, much less for everywhere else.<br /><br />The shape of future transportation systems centers around the changing role of the automobile. This in turn is being influenced by the transition from a predominantly rural global society to a largely urban one. By 2020 close to 55 percent of us will be living in cities, where the role of cars is diminishing. In Europe, where this process is well along, car sales in almost every country have peaked and are falling.<br /><br />With world oil output close to peaking, there will not be enough economically recoverable oil to support a world fleet expansion along U.S. lines or, indeed, to sustain the U.S. fleet. Oil shocks are now a major security risk. The United States, where 88 percent of the 133 million working people travels to work by car, is dangerously vulnerable.<br /><br />Beyond the desire to stabilize climate, drivers almost everywhere are facing gridlock and worsening congestion that are raising both frustration and the cost of doing business. In the United States, the average commuting time for workers has increased steadily since the early 1980s. The automobile promised mobility, but after a point its growing numbers in an increasingly urbanized world offer only the opposite: immobility.<br /><br />While the future of transportation in cities lies with a mix of light rail, buses, bicycles, cars, and walking, the future of intercity travel over distances of 500 miles or less belongs to high-speed trains.
