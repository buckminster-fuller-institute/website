But a new concrete that can heal its own wounds may soon bring futuristic protection to bridges and roads.<br /><br />Traditional concrete is brittle and is easily fractured during an earthquake or by overuse.<br /><br />By contrast, the new concrete composite can bend into a U-shape without breaking. When strained, the material forms hairline cracks, which auto-seal after a few days of light rain.<br /><br />Dry material exposed by the cracks reacts with rainwater and carbon dioxide in the air to form "scars" of calcium carbonate, a strong compound found naturally in seashells, said study co-author Victor Li of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.<br /><br />The flexible material is just as strong after it heals, the study authors report.

Pierpont Morgan, free electricity for one and all.  It was the inventor's biggest project, and his most audacious.<br /><br />The first tower rose on rural Long Island and, by 1903, stood more than 18 stories tall. One midsummer night, it emitted a dull rumble and proceeded to hurl bolts of electricity into the sky. The blinding flashes, The New York Sun reported, "seemed to shoot off into the darkness on some mysterious errand."<br /><br />But the system failed for want of money, and at least partly for scientific viability. Tesla never finished his prototype tower and was forced to abandon its adjoining laboratory.<br /><br />Today, a fight is looming over the ghostly remains of that site, called Wardenclyffe - what Tesla authorities call the only surviving workplace of the eccentric genius who dreamed countless big dreams while pioneering wireless communication and alternating current. The disagreement began recently after the property went up for sale in Shoreham, N.Y.<br /><br />A science group on Long Island wants to turn the 16-acre site into a Tesla museum and education center, and hopes to get the land donated to that end. But the owner, the Agfa Corporation, says it must sell the property to raise money in hard economic times. The company's real estate broker says the land, listed at $1.6 million, can "be delivered fully cleared and level," a statement that has thrown the preservationists into action.

In addition, using mirrors to reduce the number of photovoltaic cells needed, it makes the cost of solar energy roughly comparable to fossil fuels.<br /><br />While this technology has been implemented elsewhere, Israeli start-up ZenithSolar - working in conjunction with Israel's Ben-Gurion University - is a pioneer in combining it with a water-based cooling system that increases the photovoltaic cells' efficiency and produces thermal energy to boot.<br /><br />"We're the first to develop a cogeneration machine which will harness sunlight to produce thermal energy together with electrical energy at the same time," said Roy Segev, founder and CEO of ZenithSolar, at a launch party Monday at this kibbutz, or communal agricultural settlement, located on Israel's coastal plain east of Ashdod. This flagship plot of 16 dishes known as "Z20"s - which look like semiflattened satellite dishes with the texture of a disco ball - will generate about half of the total energy needs of this community of some 200 families.<br /><br />Israel has long sought to make the most of its location: the Negev Desert, not far from here, gets about 330 sunny days in a year. Israel recruited its first solar-energy pioneer in 1949 just after the state was founded, and Israelis have have been using solar panels on their roofs to heat water for decades - more than 1 million households in a nation of 7 million have such setups, according to a recent Business Week report.

Aging infrastructure, combined with a rise in domestic electricity consumption, has forced experts to critically examine the status and health of the nation's electrical systems.<br /><br />NPR has created this great tool to view the U.S. energy grid, the sources of power that feed it, and the proposed expansions over the next half-century.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><h2>Fuller's Earth: A Day With Buckminster Fuller and the Kids being re-released as part of the 'Classics in Progressive Education' series</h2><img src="bucky_kids.jpg" width="500" height="272" border="0" alt="bucky and the kids"><br /><br />A brilliant portrait of a dynamic teacher, Fuller's Earth by Richard J. Brenneman with a new forward by National Book Award and the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award recipient Herb Kohl, will be an inspiration to progressive educators today. Toward the end of his life, the visionary American philosopher, inventor, architect, mathematician, and poet Buckminster Fuller was asked to explain to a group of children his vision of how the universe works. The book that resulted from this encounter is not only the most straightforward exposition available of Bucky's radical worldview but also perhaps the most lovable and personal portrait ever produced of the man who has been called "the planet's friendly genius."<br /><br />Available now for pre-order from <a href="http://buckysecrets.com/">Amazon.com</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><h2>Worldometers</h2><img src="worldometer.jpg" width="500" height="339" border="0" alt="worldometer"><br /><br /><a href="http://www.worldometers.info/">Worldometers</a> is part of the Real Time Statistics Project, which is managed by an international team of developers, researchers, and volunteers with the goal of making world statistics available in a thought-provoking and time relevant format to a wide audience around the world. Chief project coordinator is currently Sir Thomasson.<br /><br />Sources are carefully selected to include only data published by the most reputable organizations and statistical offices in the world.<br /><br />The counters that display the real-time numbers are based on Worldometers' algorithm that processes the latest and most accurate statistical data available together with its estimated progression to compute the current millisecond number to be displayed on each counter based on the specific time set on each visitor’s computer clock.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><h2>13 things that do not make sense</h2> A great list and explanation of, well, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524911.600-13-things-that-do-not-make-sense.html?full=true">13 things that do not make sense</a>.<br /></td></tr><tr><td><h1>EVENTS</h1><h2>Sixth Annual Games for Change Festival</h2><img src="games4change.jpg" width="500" height="109" border="0" alt="games4change"><br /><br />This May, the only festival dedicated to the exciting new movement of Digital Games for Social Change will explore real-world impact, the latest games, and funding strategies. Hosted in New York City by Parsons The New School for Design, the <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/fest2009">6th annual Games for Change Festival</a> will take place May 27 - 29, 2009. The Annual Games for Change Festival brings together the world's leading foundations, NGOs, game-makers, academics, and journalists to explore how best to harness this incredibly powerful medium to help address the most critical issues of our day, from poverty, climate change, global conﬂicts, to human rights. Every year, the festival doubles in size and brings in new, high-impact partners.<br /><br />The festival includes 3 exciting days of panels, keynotes and brainstorming sessions, as well as funders' meetings, press briefings, a private journalists dinner, an in-conference game, birds-of-a-feather gatherings and the usual excellent networking opportunities. This year we'll also be featuring the first-ever Newsgame Award at the Expo Night on May 28th, sponsored by the Knight Foundation, an evening games Expo and reception where attendees can play these new games ﬁrst-hand and watch the awards ceremony for the best news games.<br /><br />Called "the Sundance of video games" for "socially-responsible game-makers" we're promoting a new genre of video game - games to change the world – for the better.<br /></td></tr>
