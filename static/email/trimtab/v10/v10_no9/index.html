<tr><td><h2>Prototype Program Installation at DUMBO Arts Festival in Brooklyn</h2><center><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3527/3961551310_2dca7ea173.jpg" height ="188.5" width="250"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3454/3960769311_46a5ecba16.jpg" width="250" height="188.5"></center><br /><br />September 25th - BFI's Prototype Program partook in the 13th annual <a href="http://dumboartfestival.org/">DUMBO Art Under the Bridge Festival</a> in Brooklyn, NY. Our installation transformed one of Fuller&#8217;s geodesic diagrams, <i><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3098/2651374236_34faffdbfb_b.jpg">The 25 Great Circles</a></i>, into a 12 foot high interactive climbing wall, open to public participants of all ages. Climbing holds were strategically placed at vertices and mid points of the diagram in an attempt to re-interpret the network-like drawing as a mapping not just of geodesic coordinates but of human movement. The festival was heavily attended, and one day alone saw over 140 children and adults partake in climbing upon the wall.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26050350@N04/sets/72157622469983568/">See more photographs from the installation and festival here.</a>
<tr><td><h2>WorldShelters installs housing for homeless camp in Ventura, California</h2><img src="udome.jpg" height="149" width="496"><br /><br />September 26th, saw dozens of volunteers join up with <a href="http://worldshelters.org/">WorldShelters</a> and the <a href="http://www.turningpointfoundation.org/">Turning Point Foundation</a> for the installation of 19 temporary housing domes. In took volunteers just one day to assemble the 19 domes, six U-Domes with 200 square feet of space for couples and 13 U-Domes with 120 square feet for singles. Each structure is weather worthy, rated to withstand 80 mph winds, fire retardant, and fully recyclable. They also have locking doors, windows and vents. BFI founder Allegra Fuller Snyder was on hand for the event, expressing upmost support for the project and its mission of effectively housing the homeless.<br />(Thanks to reader Dick Fischbeck for the lead on the story.)<br /><br />Read more:<br /><a href="http://sheltermovie.wordpress.com/">Sheltermovie.wordpress.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/sep/26/day-of-caring-draws-hundreds-of-volunteers/">Day of Caring Draws Hundreds of Volunteers</a><br /><br />
<tr><td><h2>Featured Store Item: <i>Structure in Nature</i> by Peter Pearce</h2><img src="structureinnature_small.jpg" height="259" width="200"><br /><br />The structural designs that occur in nature, in molecules, in crystals, in living cells, appear in this fully illustrated book as a source of inspiration and study of the design of manmade structures. In particular, the book reveals that when the geometrical modular systems developed by the author are applied to building design, the result is adaptive, structurally sound, and economical environments. Pearce&#8217;s work follows in the tradition established by D&#8217;Arcy Wentworth Thompson and Konrad Wachsmann, and reflects his earlier close association with Charles Eames and Buckminster Fuller.<br /><br />&#8220;The concepts encompassed in the book should appeal to any lover of geometry, but particularly to those interested in design.&#8221;  Walter Sullivan, The New York Times.<br /><br /><a href="http://bfi.easystorecreator.com/items/books/structure-in-nature-by-peter-pearce-133-detail.htm">On sale now for $24.95 in our online store!</a><br/><br/>

<h2>The World&#8217;s First Tensegrity Bridge Opens in Brisbane, Australia</h2><img src="brisbane.jpg" width="475" height="311"><br><br>October 2009 marked the opening of the first tensegrity based bridge in the world; <a href="http://www.publicworks.qld.gov.au/majorprojects/Pages/KurilpaBridge.aspx">the Kurilpa bridge</a> of Brisbane, Australia. Measuring 470 meters long, this pedestrial bridge represents the largest tensegirty structure to have ever been built. As with any true tensegrity system, the opposing forces of tension and compression are employed to create a strong yet lightweight structure. In additional to the structural achievements, the bridge is gaining much attention for it's energy efficiency. The bridge is lit at night with an advanced LED lighting systems that is powered by an affixed array of 84 solar panels. The bridge is projected to carry over 36,000 pedestrians and bicyclists each week.<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/04/2704221.htm">World First Brisbane Bridge Now Open</a> (ABC News)<br /><a href="http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-architecture-kurilpa-bridge-the-world-s-largest-solar-powered-footbridge/">The World's Largest Solar Powered Foot Bridge</a> (Eco Friend)<br/><a href="http://architectureforguerillas.blogspot.com/2009/09/tensegrity.html">Tensegrity</a> (Architecture for Guerillas)<br /><br />
<tr><td><h2>Illuminating Dark Economies</h2><img src="darknight.jpg" width="320" height="198"><br /><br />Measuring economic activity from outer space is a new frontier in the struggle to quantify humanity&#8217;s impact on the natural world.<br /><br />Looking down from orbit hundreds or thousands of kilometers above the sunlit surface of the Earth, the signposts of civilization are clearly visible. The vast checkerboard patterns of farmland; the thin traceries of roads, railways, and airplane contrails; Egypt&#8217;s Great Pyramid and China&#8217;s Great Wall, all are easily seen with the naked eye. But passing into night, the view changes. The signs of humanity fade save for one: light from artificial sources like electric lamps, oil refinery gas flares, and intentionally set fires.<br /><br />    In 1962, when John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth, he also clearly demonstrated that lights at night could trace human activity from space. Passing over western Australia, he reported seeing a very bright light on the ground; the citizens of Perth had coordinated to turn on as many lights as possible to signal to Glenn as he flew overhead<br>
<br />
Since that time, satellite imagery of nighttime lights has proved useful as a piecemeal method to measure development upon our planet. Static snapshots can reveal stark disparities, like the brightly glowing prosperity of South Korea beneath the darkness of the impoverished, totalitarian north. Gradual changes can be discerned, too, like when the intensity of Soviet-bloc countries&#8217; nighttime lights slowly increased after the USSR&#8217;s fall. All such observations to date have been quite crude, constrained by the fact that most of the data comes from one low-resolution source, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), an aging network of satellites formerly operated by the US Air Force but now controlled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).<br /><a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/illuminating_dark_economies/">Continue reading here.</a><br /><br />Related:<br/><a href="http://www.google.com/landing/cop15/">Explore Climate Change in Google Earth</a><br /><br /></td></tr>

<h2>Sourcemap: a collective tool for transparency and sustainability</h2><img src="souremap.jpg" height="81" width="475"><br /><br />When you invite people to an event, buy the ingredients for a recipe, or design the parts of a product, your choices have a significant impact.<br /><br />Some things have vast supply chains that stretch across the world while others are completely regional. Understanding the reach of our sourcing is fundamental to improving economic, social and environmental conditions.<br /><br />Sourcemap is a tool for producers, business owners and consumers to understand the impact of supply chains. Our site is a social network where anyone can contribute to a shared understanding of the story behind products. You can simulate the impact of manufacturing, transporting, using and throwing away products using our Life-Cycle Assessment calculator. This web-based tool uses linked data from geological and geographic resources. Each 'Sourcemap' can be used to help market socially- and environmentally- conscious products and to buy carbon offsets. Supply chains published on the site can be embedded in external websites, printed onto product packaging or linked through QR codes readable by camera phones. As the site grows, suppliers will be able to contribute their products to the Sourcemap database, providing a geographic catalogue of materials and products around the world.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.sourcemap.org/">SOURCEMAP.ORG</a><br /><br />
