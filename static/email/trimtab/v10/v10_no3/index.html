This version is based on Fuller&#8217;s popular Air/Ocean Dymaxion map which presents the world&#8217;s temperature zones shaded in attractive colors with updated city names. The globe punches out and folds up into a 5-1/2 inch icosahedron globe to illustrate the synergetic geometric principles behind this revolutionary map design.<br /><br /><a href="http://bfi.org/our_programs/who_is_buckminster_fuller/design_science/dymaxion_map">Find out more about the Dymaxion Map</a><br /><br /><a href="http://bfi.easystorecreator.com/items/maps/fold-up-globe-w-base-stand-306-detail.htm">Purchase a copy from our online store</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><h2>Job opportunity at the Buckminster Fuller Institute: Program Coordinator</h2><a href="http://bfi.org/our_programs/the_buckminster_fuller_challenge/job_opening_program_coordinator">Click here for more details about the job opening and to learn how to apply</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><h1>TRENDS & PERSPECTIVES</h1><h2>Digital mapping tools and the power of citizen journalists</h2><img src="crisiswire.jpg" width="500" height="344" border="0" alt="crisiswire"><br /><br />More and more, mapping tools are being used for real-time data collection. Some of the slickest - and most helpful - uses have been in the area of crisis warning and humanitarian issues. To be able to centralize and contextualize information from seemingly random places and from a variety of different platforms has multiple benefits.<br /><br />Officially launched in late Fall 2008 (just in time for the San Francisco fires), CrisisWire is the brain child of Nate Ritter, who popularized the hashtag on Twitter. During the San Diego fires of 2007, he used #sandiegofire to document his experience and offer on-the-ground updates during the crisis. This combined with Twitter&#8217;s various search capabilities enabled people in the area to receive pertinent information about what was happening in real-time - information that mainstream media wasn&#8217;t able to provide at such a detailed or timely level.<br /><br />From this came the idea of CrisisWire. Using a mix of tools - including Google Maps, Twitter, Blogs, Flickr, SMS and news websites - it aggregates as much information as it can concerning a specific crisis or disaster. Text, photos and videos tagged with specific keywords appear on one page so a clear picture of what is currently happening is possible. Then they are mapped based on location.<br /><br />As Nate explains to Mashable&#8217;s Mark Hopkins, &#8220;During a disaster people spend valuable time searching the Internet and waiting for the media to report on their city, their neighborhood, their street. While mainstream media serves a vital role during disasters, it is impossible to update the population on everything that is happening during a crisis.&#8221;   (Source: <a href="http://www.poptech.org/blog/index.php/archives/2411" target="_blank">Pop!

On the stump a year ago he promised a no-nonsense, let&#8217;s-fix-this approach to the nation&#8217;s mounting social and economic ills. His campaign pledges ranged from making health care insurance universally affordable to fixing schools to assuring that tax credits supporting industrial research and development wouldn&#8217;t expire.<br /><br />The research community appears optimistic that the new president will follow through with as much as Congress allows. Many experts say they are impressed with the cadre of politically astute science and biomedical advisers that President Obama has already mustered to work for his White House and with Congress.<br /><br />No surprise to anyone, &#8220;The real problem is going to be the economy,&#8221; observes physicist Leon Lederman, a Nobel laureate and former director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill.<br /><br />Federal funding for science has been eroding over the past eight years, Lederman says. Meanwhile, the nation is in a recession, continues to direct huge sums of money into overseas wars and the importation of oil, faces an expected $1.2 trillion budget deficit this year, and strains under a national debt exceeding $10.6 trillion.<br /><br />Against that backdrop, Lederman believes that reversing federal funding trends in science and engineering will prove a challenge. However, he adds, based on conversations with his former senator, Obama, &#8220;I&#8217;m convinced that he has an unusual grasp of science. Not that he can write down a differential equation. But Obama understands science in a deep way and reveals it by commenting on the beauty of new discoveries.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;To me, he deserves three checks for clearly understanding the power of science.&#8221;<br /><r />And that, Lederman argues, is why Obama&#8217;s inauguration brought him a genuine sense of hope: &#8220;It feels like the marines are arriving - and just in time, hopefully.&#8221;   (Source: <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/41224/title/Science_Stimulus" target="_blank">Science News</a>)<br /><br />Related:<br />&raquo; <a href="http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php?id=63">Science and technology related stimulus spending</a><br /></td></tr><tr><td><h2>Salt solution: cheap power from the river&#8217;s mouth</h2><img src="hydro.jpg" width="500" height="373" border="0" alt="salt power"><br /><br />Stand on the banks of the Rhine where it flows into the North Sea, near the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and you&#8217;ll witness a vast, untapped source of energy swirling in the estuary. According to Dutch engineer Joost Veerman, it&#8217;s possible to tap this energy without damaging the environment or disrupting the river&#8217;s busy shipping. For rather than constructing a huge barrage or dotting the river bed with turbines, Veerman and his colleagues at Wetsus, the Dutch Centre for Sustainable Water Technology in Leeuwarden, believe they can tap energy locked up in the North Sea&#8217;s saltwater by channelling it, along with fresh water from the Rhine, into a novel kind of battery. With a large enough array of these batteries, he says, the estuary could easily provide over a gigawatt of electricity by a process they've called Blue Energy - enough to supply about 650,000 homes.<br /><br />&#8220;Salinity power&#8221; exploits the chemical differences between salt and fresh water, and this project only hints at the technology&#8217;s potential: from the mouth of the Ganges to the Mississippi delta, almost every large estuary could produce a constant flow of green electricity, day and night, rain or shine, without damaging sensitive ecosystems or threatening fisheries (see map). One estimate has it that salinity power could eventually become a serious power player, supplying as much as 7 per cent of today&#8217;s global energy needs.<br /><br />In an attempt to prove that this isn&#8217;t just a pipe dream, Veerman&#8217;s team has done lab tests on a prototype salinity power generator, and are now planning to scale it up. Yet a group of Norwegian engineers have gone one stage further, with their own twist on salinity power.<br /><br />In the next few months, engineers at Norwegian power company Statkraft plan to throw the switch on the world&#8217;s first salinity power station. Though their prototype is small, its impact could be huge. So what are these rival technologies, how do they stack up, and what are the obstacles to making electricity wherever rivers meet the sea?

They think that coating pipes and membranes with these nanoparticles may prove to be an effective strategy for addressing one of the major problems and costs of treating water.<br /><br />&#8220;Just as plaque can build up inside arteries and reduce the flow of blood, bacteria and other microorganisms can over time attach and accumulate on water treatment membranes and along water pipes,&#8221; said So-Ryong Chae, post-doctoral fellow in Duke&#8217;s environmental and civil engineering department. The results of his experiments were published March 5 in the Journal of Membrane Sciences.
