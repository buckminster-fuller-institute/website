<h2>British Streetlights to go on Dimmer Switch for Energy Efficiency</h2><img src="streetlight.jpg" height="312" width="468"><br /><br />In a first for Britain, Coventry - a city in West Midlands - is spending £250 million over the next 25 years to convert all 28,000 of its street lights to work on city-wide dimmer switches. Each of the lights will be connected to a central control room that allows computers to turn lights up or down. The more dangerous or busy areas of the city can have lights turned to full brightness, or dimmed down during quiet hours. The sum effect is expected to save money, greenhouse gas emissions, and cut down on unnecessary light pollution. But it isn't without some controversy among city residents.<br /><br />The Telegraph reports, "Coventry City Council hope to cut their carbon emissions by 40 per cent and reduce energy bills. But residents are already concerned that when lamps on suburban streets are turned down, the elderly and families could be put at risk. Others warn that turning up lights will leave them unable to sleep at night.
