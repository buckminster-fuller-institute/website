  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK CITY (October 11, 2017) - &lt;/strong&gt;The Buckminster Fuller Challenge is pleased to announce the winner of the 2017 Challenge: Bhungroo, a project of the Sustainable Green Initiative Forum (SGIF) in Gujarat State, India. The project was submitted by Trupti Jain and Biplab Ketan Paul, SGIF’s co-founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhungroo (meaning “straw” or “hollow pipe” in Gujarati) has developed a deceptively simple, “low-tech” but highly innovative technology that can filter, inject, and store water from precipitation in the water table up to a depth of 300 meters in the subsoil. The project uses this novel technology to dramatic benefit for poor farmers in a multi-dimensional strategy that boosts crop yields and food security, raises rural incomes, improves soil fertility, combats the effects of climate change, and radically enhances the wellbeing and social status of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #EEE; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; padding: 1em&quot;&gt;The Fuller Challenge Review Committee found Bhungroo to be a perfect demonstration of one of Buckminster Fuller’s favorite dictums: &quot;&lt;em&gt;If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don&#039;t bother trying to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhungroo’s water storage system occupies a very small footprint. Using only 1 square meter of surface area to drill, it allows multiple farmers to collectively preserve and retrieve up to 40 million liters of stored rainwater. This is game changing in tropical and equatorial regions where monsoon seasons alternate with very dry periods and droughts, a situation compounded by the further instability brought by climate change. While simple to implement and operate, this water storage method is highly sophisticated and is based on a deep understanding of climatic, hydrological, and geological factors. Bhungroo uses 17 technical designs that weigh 27 variables to find the ideal locations and depths at which to store water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to alleviating hunger and poverty and enhancing food security, SGIF, which combines social enterprise with non-profit components, is strongly focused on boosting the income and status of women farmers and of others at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid because of religion, caste, or ethnicity in the often rigidly patriarchal rural regions where they work. SGIF achieves this by training groups of women farmers to form entrepreneurial collectives that run, own, and operate the water storage systems. The organization provides them with access to larger social networks and ongoing training and support. They are also developing pictorial educational apps that will permit illiterate farmers to master the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #EEE; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; padding: 1em&quot;&gt;“&lt;em&gt;While as a technological artifact, Bhungroo is scaled down as much as possible, the scale of its vision itself is global,&lt;/em&gt;” said Melissa Kelly, sustainability analyst and member of the Fuller Challenge Review Committee. “&lt;em&gt;And in its social enterprise elements, it also offers a fundamental challenge to existing social systems. The solution anticipates many critical future issues: women’s empowerment, food security, poverty alleviation, and how to become resilient in the face of rainfall patterns that will become even more erratic as the climate changes further.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhungroo’s model, which has proven to be very successful in Gujarat, is expanding to other parts of India. The SGIF team is also consulting with groups in Bangladesh, Ghana, Togo, and Vietnam that are seeking to adapt Bhungroo for their agrarian communities. This deceptively simple but revolutionary approach, which allows smallholder farmers to survive and thrive in the face of drought, monsoon flooding, and ever more erratic precipitation patterns, simultaneously empowers women and the poorest of the poor. It is clearly a “trimtab,” to use Fuller’s term, that can improve life for millions of the world’s most disenfranchised people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details on the winning proposal as well as a statement from the Fuller Challenge Review Committee can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2017/bhungroo&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2017 Buckminster Fuller Challenge Runners-Up:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Review Committee requested to honor two remarkably inspiring, groundbreaking projects as runners-up to this year’s Challenge winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sistema Biobolsa&lt;/strong&gt; distributes biomimetically-inspired, affordable, robust, lightweight, state-of-the-art bio-digesters that permit small farms, rural communities, and urban settlements to convert organic waste into renewable energy and organic fertilizer. Now operating in Colombia, India, Kenya, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Senegal and growing virally, Sistema Biobolsa plans for near global reach. This project boosts the livelihoods of small farmers who produce 80% of the world’s food; curtails illnesses caused by indoor air pollution; provides gas for clean cooking; delivers affordable, renewable, decentralized energy as well as organic fertilizers that reduce the use of toxic chemicals; reduces deforestation; cuts migration to urban slums; and combats climate change. Sistema Biobolsa provides a game-changing intervention to help small farmers around the developing world. Further details on this project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2017/sistema-biobolsa&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fideicomiso de la Tierra del Caño Martin Peña&lt;/strong&gt; (in English, the Martín Peña Channel Community Land Trust) is a remarkable local democracy and social justice initiative. A historically disenfranchised “informal” community near the center of San Juan, Puerto Rico, situated in the floodplain of a highly polluted waterway, has organized itself to demand environmental restoration while simultaneously working to prevent gentrification and provide affordable housing and access to critical infrastructure for its inhabitants. The project’s leaders decided to use a Community Land Trust (CLT) as the vehicle for community empowerment. They secured collective legal tenure of 200 contiguous acres of land in perpetuity, something truly historic and almost unheard of in such urban contexts. By tackling land rights, environmental restoration, and social justice in a multi-pronged approach, they have launched an unprecedented comprehensive development model, one already being referenced for replication by communities in Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and South Africa. Further details on this project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/ideaindex/projects/2017/martin-pena-community-land-trust&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #EEE; text-align: left; font-size: 12px; padding: 1em&quot;&gt;“&lt;em&gt;On behalf of the Fuller Challenge team, we would like to extend our congratulations to the 2017 winner and our runner-up honorees!&lt;/em&gt;” remarked Elizabeth Thompson, Founding Director of the Fuller Challenge. &quot;&lt;em&gt;As this is the final year of the program’s first decade, it feels fitting to award our prize to Bhungroo, a project so focused on the design of solutions that meet the basic human needs of an expanding population in a part of the world increasingly challenged by the effects of climate change, persistent poverty, and food insecurity. The selection of the project by the Review Committee also signals recognition that empowering women is a fundamental driver of systemic change.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2017 grand prize will be awarded to Bhungroo in New York City on the evening of November 10th, followed by a day-long symposium gathering all 10 winners of the Buckminster Fuller Challenge since 2008.

 <link>https://www.bfi.org/dymaxion-forum/2017/09/announcing-2017-fuller-challenge-finalists</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK CITY&lt;/strong&gt; - The Buckminster Fuller Challenge is pleased to announce the six Finalists for the 2017 program cycle. These Finalists have reached the final deliberation phase and are under consideration for selection to win the Buckminster Fuller Challenge and its grand prize of $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in its tenth anniversary cycle, the Fuller Challenge remains the only prize program specifically working to identify, catalyze, and celebrate projects that employ whole systems approaches to problem solving. The Fuller Challenge puts forth a global call for solutions that address humanity&#039;s most pressing problems, welcoming submissions from all fields. In response to this open call, designers, architects, activists, entrepreneurs, artists, planners, scientists, and other comprehensive design practitioners submit entries that present integrated strategies informed by an understanding of whole systems. The Fuller Challenge continues to attract geographically diverse applicants working in communities and eco-systems around the world. This year, the Challenge received more than 460 entries—a record number for the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six proposals now under consideration for the 2017 grand prize have undergone a rigorous, multi-stage review process for adherence to the entry criteria by the Fuller Challenge Review Committee, a diverse group of advisors and experts led by a seasoned review team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;On behalf of the Fuller Challenge review team, we would like to congratulate our six finalists. Each is tackling an incredibly difficult set of interrelated issues; each putting forth a new model that reveals the inadequacies of current practices.  It is our hope that recognition by the Fuller Challenge will help these initiatives to reach a wider audience and will result in an increase of recognition and support for each of them,&lt;/em&gt;&quot; said Elizabeth Thompson, Founding Director of the Fuller Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed information about each project and associated images can be viewed on the Buckminster Fuller Institute&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge/finalists&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 10th anniversary celebration of the Buckminster Fuller Challenge and the conferring of the 2017 grand prize will take place in New York City on November 10-11. The event will be open to the public, so please save the date and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/2017-bfc-celebration&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; your intent to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

Operating in the Gujarat state of India with consultancy-based projects in Bangladesh, Ghana, Togo, and Vietnam, Bhungroo has 17 technical designs for a variety of soil types and agro-climatic zones and can be customized based on 27 variables. Using only 1 square meter of surface area, Bhungroo allows multiple farmers to collectively preserve and retrieve stored rainwater. In an area where female farmers are often disregarded as contributing members of society, this exemplary social enterprise also has a non-profit component that trains women who are smallholder farmers to collectively own the subsoil water stored by Bhungroo and to provide fee-based services to other smallholder farmers in their village, confronting repressive social structures that have dominated the region for 400 years. Their program will be made available to illiterate farmers through the development of an app that utilizes a pictorial format. Bhungroo, through the provision of a simple yet elegant, trimtab-like technology, can equip smallholder farmers to be able to face drought, monsoon flooding, and unpredictable precipitation patterns related to climate change while simultaneously empowering women and the poorest of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify-all;font-size: 12px;line-height: 15px;margin-top: 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Vertical University Project&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.belt-project.org&quot;&gt;KTK-BELT&lt;/a&gt; approaches conservation and education in Nepal, the most vertical country in the world, through the design of a “Vertical University” comprising cooperatively owned “Learning Grounds” at various altitudes in distinct ecological areas. Thirty-three such Learning Grounds currently serve as place-based centers for ecological education and skills development. KTK-BELT engages farmers and youth to become stewards of biodiversity and their unique local environments, providing livelihood opportunities through the preservation and cultivation of unique plant and animal species, such as the Himalayan soap nut and the pangolin, as well as the preservation of local indigenous knowledge of the flora and fauna, of local agricultural and wildcrafting techniques, and of herbal medical traditions, such as the cultivation, production and use of 150 unique essential oils found in one particular area. By connecting farmers and youth in the region and developing a collective ownership model for safeguarding land, KTK-BELT is addressing the threats of encroachment by developers as well as the outmigration of youth seeking economic opportunities elsewhere. One hundred-fifty farming families have pledged to retain their land for the next 7 years after coming to understand their region as a haven of biodiversity with long-term value as well as a base of opportunity for ecologically-grounded livelihoods, sustainable agriculture, and ecotourism.&lt;/p&gt;

The project takes on the environmental restoration of the Caño Martín Peña, a polluted, degraded tidal channel located in the heart of the San Juan Bay estuary with important ecological and economic significance, while simultaneously working to prevent gentrification and provide affordable housing and access to critical infrastructure for the inhabitants. The project’s leaders decided to use a Community Land Trust (CLT) as a vehicle for community empowerment. They secured collective legal tenure of 200 contiguous acres of land in perpetuity, something truly historic and almost unheard of in such urban contexts. By tackling land rights, environmental restoration, and social justice in a multi-pronged approach, they have launched an unprecedented comprehensive development model. The CLT has kickstarted 65 social and economic development initiatives, engaged 1,600 community youth, and successfully relocated over 600 families to allow for suitable infrastructure development. The novel application of the CLT’s collective ownership model to an informal settlement is a truly revolutionary model, already being referenced for replication by communities in Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

We allow them to disperse because we&#039;ve been ignorant of their value.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; -R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify-all;font-size: 12px;line-height: 15px;margin-top: 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://net-works.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net-Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership between Interface, the renowned, groundbreaking, eco-conscious carpet company, and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), is a highly innovative program that interweaves community development, environmental protection, and closed-loop economic production. Interface wanted to source recycled material in a way that would benefit communities and the environment, and ZSL wanted to develop a model of community-based conservation that would be self-funding, empowering, and bring immediate benefits to local people. The result is Net-Works. So far, 24 poor fishing communities in the Philippines and 9 in the Lake Ossa region of Cameroon recover and recycle discarded nylon fishing nets into yarn for use as carpet tiles. A dangerous waste product that harms marine life becomes a valuable raw material. A fair price is paid for the nets and a community-based supply chain is created. Also, innovative local banking initiatives, including community-managed savings and loan groups and a collective Environment Fund that invests in local conservation projects, help break donor dependency and make conservation self-funding. Net-Works is helping to restore marine life through the establishment of marine-protected areas and the replenishment of mangrove forests while strengthening local economies and enhancing community well-being and resiliency. This impressive project is now poised to expand into Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

Through their open-source platform and rapidly growing collaborative community, they promote an ecosystem of air quality information that has enabled previously impossible cross disciplinary and international collaborations, scientific research projects, policy initiatives, and newly empowered, informed activism. Air pollution, responsible for 1 out of every 8 deaths in the world, has enormous impacts on health and the global economy, and very poor communities often suffer the brunt of those adverse impacts. Meaningful access to air quality data can effectively arm citizens across sectors, institutions, and communities to combat dirty air. Many governments, including those in severely polluted places, publish air quality data, but often in forms that make it difficult or impossible to access for most people. No government, international organization, or other group had made these data open and universally formatted prior to OpenAQ’s innovative platform. Beyond its data aggregation and sharing, OpenAQ is committed to on-the-ground convenings and has, so far, held three pilot workshops in Bosnia, India, and Mongolia to bring together journalists, scientists, software developers, artists, policymakers, and others to address air inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

Based on a biomimetic model that originated in the early 20th century, Sistema Biobolsa has re-designed the common bio-digester to provide a state-of-the-art, robust system with a high-quality membrane comprising modular parts that is compact enough to be distributable via donkeys, motorbikes, or boats. This has allowed Sistema.bio to scale to serve farmers in Colombia, India, Kenya, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Senegal and is growing virally, with plans for near global reach. The bio-digesters convert waste into fertilizer for agricultural application and produce natural gas used for clean cooking and heating water, thereby reducing indoor air pollution and combatting deforestation. The gas is also used to run small engines for mechanical and electrical needs, providing affordable, renewable, decentralized energy to hitherto electricity-deprived populations. Sistema.bio places a heavy focus on the monitoring and evaluation of their technology. Their replication package includes technical and communication tools that allow local representatives to track potential waste streams, calculate energy values, order systems and track and report impacts over time. This highly effective project provides a game-changing approach to boosting the livelihoods and well-being of small farmers (who grow 80% of the world’s food).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;SYMPOSIUM PROGRAM DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Design Revolution&lt;/strong&gt; -  &lt;em&gt;How is Bucky’s call for a Design Science Revolution (1961) going? What is the role of design in solving the complex problems of our era? How can nature-inspired, biomimetic, regenerative, and “design science” approaches achieve better outcomes than design has in our past? How do we accelerate the adoption of these approaches? How do we incentivize more resources to flow toward projects taking the anticipatory &#039;long view&#039;? What do we need in order to better leverage visionary and innovative design approaches?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panelists:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toddecological.com/&quot;&gt;John Todd&lt;/a&gt; (ecological design pioneer, president, John Todd Design); &lt;a href=&quot;http://professional.mit.edu/instructors/ryan-chin&quot;&gt;Ryan Chin&lt;/a&gt; (Co-Founder &amp;amp; CEO, Optimus Ride, Inc.); &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecovativedesign.com/about&quot;&gt;Gavin McIntyre&lt;/a&gt; (Co-founder &amp;amp; Chief Scientist, Ecovative); &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/edenbrukman/&quot;&gt;Eden Bruckman&lt;/a&gt;, (Senior Green Building Coordinator, City of SF, Dept. of Environment; Co-founder, The Living Building Challenge)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderator:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metropolismag.com/bios/susan-szenasy/&quot;&gt;Susan Szenasy&lt;/a&gt;, (Publisher and Editor in Chief, Metropolis Magazine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrestrial Ecosystems - &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Extractive industries and large scale agribusiness are ravaging the global environment, impoverishing soils, imperiling biodiversity, massively toxifying terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and driving indigenous and poor populations into urban slums. What strategies do we need to deploy to preserve and regenerate vital lands, restore our biosphere, provide food and resources for the world&#039;s population needs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panelists:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/02/12/news/rainforest-negotiator&quot;&gt;Jody Holmes&lt;/a&gt; (Director, The Rainforest Solutions Project); &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.planet-tech.com/seth-itzkan&quot;&gt;Seth Itzkan&lt;/a&gt;, (Advisor, The Savory Institute; Co-Founder, Soil4Climate); &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naireetaservices.com/team/&quot;&gt;Trupti Jain&lt;/a&gt; (Co-Founder, Bhungroo); &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naireetaservices.com/team/&quot;&gt;Biplab Ketan Paul&lt;/a&gt; (Co-Founder, Bhungroo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderator:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centerforneweconomics.org/people/greg-watson&quot;&gt;Greg Watson&lt;/a&gt; (Director of Policy and Systems Design, The Schumacher Center for New Economics)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aquatic Ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Our oceans, and fresh water resources, which generate the majority of the planet&#039;s oxygen and are the main drivers of our weather are under assault from warming, overfishing, plasticization, acidification, contamination, depletion, coral bleaching, etc. The livelihoods of countless coastal communities are threatened. How do we build a new relationship between humanity and aquatic ecosystems? What are the key trimtabs to create this kind of change? What are the key critical challenges for the next ten years? How do we get more people to understand the opportunities?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panelists:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toddecological.com/&quot;&gt;John Todd&lt;/a&gt;, (ecological design pioneer, president, John Todd Design);  &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenwave.org/team&quot;&gt;Bren Smith&lt;/a&gt; (Executive Director and Co-founder, Greenwave); &lt;a href=&quot;https://blueventures.org/team/marc-fruitema/&quot;&gt;Marc Fruitema&lt;/a&gt; (Support Program Manager, Blue Ventures); &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scapestudio.com/people/gena-wirth/&quot;&gt;Gena Wirth&lt;/a&gt; (Design Principal, SCAPE Studio)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderator:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinmeezan/&quot;&gt;Erin Meezan&lt;/a&gt;, (VP and Chief Sustainability Officer, Interface, Inc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urban Ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Our species is now predominantly urban. How we organize, develop and manage our cities—and the materials, goods, services, and resources required to sustain them—will be key determinants of our ability to thrive in the future. How do we transform our megalopolises into sustainable, resilient human settlements in the face of climate change? What does an integrated approach look like, in terms of ensuring that our cities are healthy, energy neutral, safe, culturally inclusive, aesthetically energizing places to live?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panelists: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://professional.mit.edu/instructors/ryan-chin&quot;&gt;Ryan Chin&lt;/a&gt; (Co-Founder &amp;amp; CEO, Optimus Ride, Inc.); &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/edenbrukman/&quot;&gt;Eden Bruckman&lt;/a&gt;, (Senior Green Building Coordinator, City of SF, Dept. of Environment; Co-founder, The Living Building Challenge); &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scapestudio.com/people/kate-orff/&quot;&gt;Kate Orff&lt;/a&gt; (Founder and Partner, SCAPE Studio)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderator:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/people/andrew-revkin&quot;&gt;Andrew Revkin&lt;/a&gt;, (Senior reporter, ProPublica; Editor, NYTimes dot.earth blog)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilience Strategies&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;What does it take to work on the whole system? In the face of setbacks, disappointments, and obstacles, how do we remain inspired to solve humanity’s most pressing problems? Complexity creates so much uncertainty. How can designers, inventors, and innovators face the unknown and remain proactive? What types of resources and tools are necessary for a systemic approach to persist in the long-term? How can we ensure that the strategies we enact through our work do not lose sight of the big picture?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panelists:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenwave.org/team&quot;&gt;Bren Smith&lt;/a&gt; (Executive Director and Co-founder, Greenwave); &lt;a href=&quot;https://blueventures.org/team/marc-fruitema/&quot;&gt;Marc Fruitema&lt;/a&gt; (Support Program Manager, Blue Ventures); &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/02/12/news/rainforest-negotiator&quot;&gt;Jody Holmes&lt;/a&gt; (Director, The Rainforest Solutions Project); &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.savory.global/institute/our-team/#tre-cates&quot;&gt;Tre&#039; Cates&lt;/a&gt; (Chief Operations Officer, Savory Institute); &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naireetaservices.com/team/&quot;&gt;Trupti Jain&lt;/a&gt; (Co-Founder, Bhungroo); &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naireetaservices.com/team/&quot;&gt;Biplab Ketan Paul&lt;/a&gt; (Co-Founder, Bhungroo); &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecovativedesign.com/about&quot;&gt;Gavin McIntyre&lt;/a&gt; (Co-founder &amp;amp; Chief Scientist, Ecovative)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderator:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://reneelertzman.com/renees-bio/&quot;&gt;Renee Lertzman&lt;/a&gt; (Social psychologist; Author, &lt;em&gt;Environmental Melancholia: psychoanalytic dimensions of engagement&lt;/em&gt;; climate change communication expert)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Announcing the 2017 Fuller Challenge Semifinalists</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/dymaxion-forum/2017/08/announcing-2017-fuller-challenge-semifinalists</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 17th, 2017, New York City:&lt;/strong&gt; The Buckminster Fuller Challenge is delighted to announce the Semifinalists for the 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge&quot;&gt;Fuller Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. A record number of entries were submitted in this 10th anniversary cycle of the program. Seventeen proposals were selected as Semifinalists from more than 460 entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buckminster Fuller Challenge program has been highlighting and celebrating exceptional examples of “whole systems” design across many sectors for the past 10 years. Launched in 2007, the program has been widely regarded as &quot;socially-responsible design’s highest award&quot; (first recognized by Metropolis Magazine in 2010). The 2017 Fuller Challenge Semifinalists are exemplars of innovative, multi-pronged approaches to addressing critical problems in agriculture, architecture, climate change, community planning, education, ecology, economic development, energy, human health, materials, sanitation, environmental and social justice, and other domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seventeen Semifinalists have undergone rigorous evaluation for adherence to the Fuller Challenge criteria over a period of 4 months by members of the Challenge Review Committee, which includes more than a dozen long-standing reviewers as well as external advisors and experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the list of Semifinalists below is categorized into problem spaces, the proposed solutions reflect integrated strategies that respond to multiple issues simultaneously as required in the Fuller Challenge &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/dymaxion-forum/2017/01/call-proposals-2017-fuller-challenge&quot;&gt;Call for Proposals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;These Semifinalists were drawn from a truly exceptional pool of initiatives.  We were very gratified – having been at this for ten years now – to see that the quality of the visions, the caliber of the teams, and the commitment to solving complex issues demonstrated in the entry pool were at an all-time high. It seems fitting to conclude and celebrate the first ten-year chapter of this prize program with the knowledge that comprehensive, anticipatory approaches to problem solving are on the rise around the world. On behalf of the entire Fuller Challenge team, we want to extend our congratulations to this year’s Semifinalists!&lt;/em&gt;&quot; said Elizabeth Thompson, Fuller Challenge Founding Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The 2017 Buckminster Fuller Challenge Semifinalists are: &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;ENERGY &amp;amp; THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/LifeArk.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lifeark.net/&quot;&gt;LifeArk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; presents a physical solution to vulnerable human living conditions caused by climate change, natural disasters, armed conflict, and economic disparity through a pre-fabricated, modular building system that can create self-sustaining aquatic or terrestrial communities. Today, more than 1 billion people around the world dwell in slums, while more than 65 million people have become refugees or have been forcibly displaced . The LifeArk solution is a rapidly deployable structure that is flexible enough to respond to each individual community’s needs through its various configurations. It is fitted for transportation in standard shipping containers, can be mass produced at low cost and rapidly assembled with commonly available tools, and it allows for a variety of structure types, including community centers, health clinics, schools, hydroponic farms, and dwelling units—all of which can have a lifespan of 25-30 years. The units will contain built-in amenities as well as off-grid systems for clean water, energy, and waste management. The globally-adaptable LifeArk design is about to be prototyped on a lake in Texas and then deployed in the pilot community of Santa Rosa, Peru, along the Amazon River. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/LiterofLight.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: right&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literoflight.org&quot;&gt;Liter of Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; redesigns solar lighting for the more than 1 billion people who suffer from energy poverty across the globe. Rather than depending on imported, patented, and expensive technologies, this grassroots, sustainable lighting movement embodies the principle that anyone can become a solar engineer. The program trains cooperatives of women and seeds their entrepreneurial activities with materials and tools to create micro-solar panels and solar battery kits that can provide energy to lanterns, mobile chargers, and streetlights. Products are manufactured at one-third the market rate, but more importantly, local people gain skills toward their livelihood. Liter of Light also works with children in schools, corporate volunteers, and local governments through workshops in order to build solar lamps for donation. It takes 30 minutes to convert a harmful kerosene lamp into a solar product, or 1 hour to make a streetlight that will provide clean energy for 5 years. The program has trained more than 6,700 adults and children and has impacted over 750,000 homes. Based in the Philippines, Liter of Light has operations in over 30 countries, with larger markets in India, Malaysia, Nepal, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Egypt, Kenya, Senegal, and South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/Solarkiosk.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://solarkiosk.eu&quot;&gt;SOLARKIOSK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a social enterprise that distributes E-HUBBs: an energy-connectivity gateway and last-mile distribution network for underserved communities. A single E-HUBB can accommodate 40 kWp solar panels, a battery pack for 24/7 power supply, power monitoring capabilities, a wireless hotspot antenna, phone and computer charging, a printer, an LED TV, a solar fridge, a fan, an alarm, air conditioning, a water purification system, interior lighting as well as flood lights, medical equipment, and a minimum of 20 meters of shelving and storage space. The flexibility of the E-HUBB has been demonstrated by various specialty applications, including: an education center at the Kafa Biosphere Reserve in Ethiopia; a solar school unit for the displaced population at the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan; a health clinic supporting the efforts of the Jordan Ministry of Health for displaced populations; a water purification E-HUBB in Kenya; and a banking kiosk that will bring financial tools to off-grid populations in Nigeria. E-HUBBs can be modified to provide spaces for gathering communities, education, health, retail, administration, water purification, and more. This project has grown very rapidly, meeting communities’ needs while empowering local entrepreneurs and boosting livelihoods. Ninety percent of the E-Hubb operators are women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/VillaCorintios.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: right&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://larepublica.pe/impresa/domingo/829621-el-sueno-del-barrio-sostenible&quot;&gt;Habitat Indoors’ Villa Corintios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  offers an exemplary design for transforming an informal settlement in the district of San Juan de Lurigancho in Lima, Peru, into a model of enlightened, “green” urbanism. Villa Corintios will include, when completed, a terraced landscape inspired by ancient Incan techniques, a greenbelt, and productive parks that will contain agricultural allotments and fish farms. Abundant local stone will be used for flooring, and homes will be made of prefabricated concrete as well as other local and recycled materials. In this foggy region of Peru, the air humidity, which can reach up to 90%, will permit water collection through fog-catchers and condensers. Wastewater and greywater will be treated and reused onsite. Organic waste will be transformed into gas energy and fertilizer by micro-enterprises. The community expects to achieve extensive yearly water use, waste, and carbon dioxide emission reductions. The design, which includes health-care infrastructure, the creation of some 500 jobs, and the incubation of 10 local companies, will radically boost the well-being of the inhabitants and provide a model for the transformation of poor, underserved “informal” urban settlements into vibrant, sustainable, healthy communities. After legalizing possession of the territory for the current inhabitants, Habitat Indoors has fully engaged the local community in the planning and construction process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/ElIngenio.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elingenio.org.mx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;El Ingenio by Germinalia A.C. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an interdisciplinary educational initiative dedicated to nurturing the creativity of young minds and imparting skills that permit poor children to thrive in both the economic marketplace and in their personal fulfilment. Using innovative, immersive, “hands-on” music creation and production, literacy and literature, design, architecture, science, technology  arts, and DIY crafts workshops, courses, exhibits, concerts, and lab work, the project has seen great success in its pedagogic goals. Founded in San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas, Mexico, as a reaction to an educational system based on rote learning that stifles creativity, El Ingenio developed a strong interdisciplinary focus, an integrated approach to learning, and a core philosophy of engaging full community participation at every level of decision making, from designing, building or retrofitting the learning spaces to designing curricula. With an aim toward eventual self-sufficiency, this nonprofit has spun off Geniart, a for-profit counterpart that closes the gap between creative education and creative production by marketing the high-quality products (furniture, books, CDs, etc.) generated in the learning environments. Germinalia has expanded to other regions of Mexico and has a long-term plan to replicate its innovative model throughought the country and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/MartinPena.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: right&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cano3punto7.org/nuevo/index-english.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fideicomiso de la Tierra del Caño Martín Peña&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (in English, Martín Peña Channel Community Land Trust) has designed the ENLACE project to address a variety of pressing needs in a poor, underserved, historically disenfranchised “informal” community near the center of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The project takes on the environmental restoration of the Caño Martín Peña, a polluted, degraded tidal channel located in the heart of the San Juan Bay estuary with important ecological and economic significance, while simultaneously working to prevent gentrification and provide affordable housing and access to critical infrastructure for the inhabitants. The project’s leaders decided to use a Community Land Trust (CLT) as a vehicle for community empowerment. They secured collective legal tenure of 200 contiguous acres of land in perpetuity, something truly historic and almost unheard of in such urban contexts. By tackling land rights, environmental restoration, and social justice in a multi-pronged approach, they have launched an unprecedented comprehensive development model. The CLT has kickstarted 65 social and economic development initiatives, engaged 1,600 community youth, and successfully relocated over 600 families to allow for suitable infrastructure development. The novel application of the CLT’s collective ownership model to an informal settlement is a truly revolutionary model, already being referenced for replication by communities in Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2016/SemiKTKBelt.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.belt-project.org&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Vertical University Project by KTK-BELT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approaches conservation and education in Nepal, the most vertical country in the world, through the design of a “Vertical University” comprising cooperatively owned “Learning Grounds” at various altitudes in distinct ecological areas. Thirty-three such Learning Grounds currently serve as place-based centers for ecological education and skills development. KTK-BELT engages farmers and youth to become stewards of biodiversity and their unique local environments, providing livelihood opportunities through the preservation and cultivation of unique plant and animal species, such as the Himalayan soap nut and the pangolin, as well as the preservation of local indigenous knowledge of the flora and fauna, of local agricultural and wildcrafting techniques, and of herbal medical traditions, such as the cultivation, production and use of 150 unique essential oils found in one particular area. By connecting farmers and youth in the region and developing a collective ownership model for safeguarding land, KTK-BELT is addressing the threats of encroachment by developers as well as the outmigration of youth seeking economic opportunities elsewhere. One hundred-fifty farming families have pledged to retain their land for the next 7 years after coming to understand their region as a haven of biodiversity with long-term value as well as a base of opportunity for ecologically-grounded livelihoods, sustainable agriculture, and ecotourism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/MedicMobile.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: right&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://medicmobile.org&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medic Mobile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; equips community health workers with digital tools that radically boost the capacity of regional medical networks in poor countries to provide effective care and reach far more people, including those in the most isolated communities. With main offices in Nairobi, Kathmandu and San Francisco, Medic Mobile is active in 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America. Its open-source tools have been used by more than 13,000 health workers caring for eight million people, and they are on track to equip another 200,000 health workers by the end of 2021. Their innovations include the design of a novel “thin-SIM” system for collecting data using very cheap, locally-available phones, a smartphone application for more complex task management, and new web applications for facility-based health staff. Medic Mobile is committed to the innovative use of simple, robust communications technologies to reach the most disadvantaged people to ensure that whole populations get the medical care they need, as well as to using their tools and networks to support effective, data-driven strategies to eliminate malnutrition, monitor disease outbreaks at their earliest stages, and provide such vital services as antenatal care, cervical cancer screening, immunizations, etc., to hitherto disenfranchised populations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/OpenAQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openaq.org&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fosters a far-flung series of grassroots networks that fight “air inequality” by building and using the only global, real-time and historical, open-air quality data platform in the world, aggregating data from, so far, 47 countries and more than 5,400 ground stations. Through their open-source platform and rapidly growing collaborative community, they promote an ecosystem of air quality information that has enabled previously impossible cross disciplinary and international collaborations, scientific research projects, policy initiatives, and newly empowered, informed activism. Air pollution, responsible for 1 out of every 8 deaths in the world, has enormous impacts on health and the global economy, and very poor communities often suffer the brunt of those adverse impacts. Meaningful access to air quality data can effectively arm citizens across sectors, institutions, and communities to combat dirty air. Many governments, including those in severely polluted places, publish air quality data, but often in forms that make it difficult or impossible to access for most people. No government, international organization, or other group had made these data open and universally formatted prior to OpenAQ’s innovative platform. Beyond its data aggregation and sharing, OpenAQ is committed to on-the-ground convenings and has, so far, held three pilot workshops in Bosnia, India, and Mongolia to bring together journalists, scientists, software developers, artists, policymakers, and others to address air inequality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/SHRI.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: right&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sanrights.org&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanitation and Health Rights India (SHRI) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is working to end open defecation in the Bihar and Jharkhand states of northern India. An estimated 110 million of the 135 million people in these states defecate in the open. In India, open defecation causes the spread of diseases that kill an estimated 300,000 children under the age of 5 and result in $38 billion in health-related costs each year. SHRI constructs community toilet facilities that include hand-washing stations and a biogas digester, which uses the human waste to power a generator that produces electricity, which, in turn, powers a small water filtration plant that uses a patented resin filter to remove arsenic, fluoride, iron, and bacterial contaminants from the local groundwater. The resulting potable water is sold for less than half the current market cost, allowing SHRI to offset its operational costs while providing free toilets and cheaper potable water to the community. SHRI currently operates five facilities, each of which provides toilets and potable water for 1,500 people and costs only $30,000 to build—80% cheaper than what it would cost the government to provide toilets without access to clean drinking water, and has plans to expand its model throughout India. This is a great example of a comprehensive, effective, self-sustaining, multi-faceted approach to problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/ToiletsandTaps.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sana.org.in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toilets and Taps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another inspiring initiative seeking to eliminate the need for open defecation in India, where over 600 million people still do not have access to a toilet. Toilets and Taps works in the Visakhapatnam District of Andhra Pradesh state in southern India, primarily in small Dalit villages and all-girl tribal schools. Dalits and tribal peoples have historically found themselves at the lowest rungs of the social pyramid due to India’s ancient but still deeply-rooted caste system. The organization sets up 20 community bio-toilet units per village and 10 units per school, all equipped with a solar-powered water station that converts contaminated groundwater into 1.8 million liters of clean drinking water per year, sold at well below-market rates. The toilets do not require a septic tank or secondary waste treatment, as an inoculum of bacteria completely digests the waste, so no human intervention is required. Local men and women are trained to operate and manage the plant and machinery. With an overall human-centered approach, Toilets and Taps is strongly focused on gender equity and social justice. The comprehensive scope of its work includes a lot of public health education and on-the-ground community organizing. This is another great example of a project that radically boosts health, wellbeing, and awareness in the poorest, most oppressed communities with the use of robust, innovative green technologies and effective social strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;MATERIALS ECONOMY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/LaborVoices.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: right&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laborvoices.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LaborVoices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revolutionizes transparency in global labor markets. Millions of workers in the global apparel sector are vulnerable to life-threatening risks on a daily basis. Despite the uptick in social-compliance monitoring over the past decade, labor abuses are still commonplace. Multinational brands have limited visibility into working conditions at facilities where their goods are produced, relying heavily on traditional social-compliance approaches like audits and hotlines that have been proven to misrepresent true workplace conditions. In response, LaborVoices has designed an unprecedented technology platform (Symphony) that allows workers to report on working conditions free of cost and anonymously through their phones. LaborVoices aggregates this data and makes it easily accessible to factory management and brands in real-time. LaborVoices also educates workers on ethical labor practices and helps them find the best places to work. LaborVoices has launched Symphony successfully in Bangladesh and Turkey, acquiring 30,000 workers as users and more than 300 factories in its database in less than one year. They have identified and resolved labor issues such as unpaid wages, abuse, human trafficking, forced labor, poor sanitary conditions, and unsafe buildings. Now that they have proven that the platform can improve global apparel supply chains, they aim to bring the solution to new markets around the world in need of such transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/NetWorks.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://net-works.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net-Works &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership between Interface, the renowned, groundbreaking, eco-conscious carpet company, and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), is a highly innovative program that interweaves community development, environmental protection, and closed-loop economic production. Interface wanted to source recycled material in a way that would benefit communities and the environment, and ZSL wanted to develop a model of community-based conservation that would be self-funding, empowering, and bring immediate benefits to local people. The result is Net-Works. So far, 24 poor fishing communities in the Philippines and 9 in the Lake Ossa region of Cameroon recover and recycle discarded nylon fishing nets into yarn for use as carpet tiles. A dangerous waste product that harms marine life becomes a valuable raw material. A fair price is paid for the nets and a community-based supply chain is created. Also, innovative local banking initiatives, including community-managed savings and loan groups and a collective Environment Fund that invests in local conservation projects, help break donor dependency and make conservation self-funding. Net-Works is helping to restore marine life through the establishment of marine-protected areas and the replenishment of mangrove forests while strengthening local economies and enhancing community well-being and resiliency. This impressive project is now poised to expand into Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2016/SemiPPX.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: right&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xaquixe.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procesos Proambientales Xaquixe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (PPX), based in Oaxaca, Mexico, has created a methodology for micro-industrial sustainability using alternative energy technologies adapted to materials from local waste streams. This system fosters a transdisciplinary network of small enterprises or “ecoclusters” of trained local specialists who share knowledge and resources to enrich communities and economies. Small enterprises and artisans are often the most dynamic part of an economy and the most vital to local resilience, but this sector does not receive the attention it merits. PPX supports small enterprises that use heat-treat processes to create artisanal products (e.g. mezcal, glass, ceramics, etc.), helping to co-create alternative technology solutions that lower energy consumption and costs and radically decrease environmental degradation and pollution. Their endeavors include a non-profit laboratory arm that advances green technologies based on local resources, a skills training center and consultancy that supports local entrepreneurs to co-design equipment as well as combustion and waste systems, and a regional platform for support, knowledge sharing, and inspiration to increase cross-sector collaboration and experimentation. Their model of a new “regional operating system” that emphasizes local materials and wisdom and existing waste streams can be applied to other systems and regions, much like the application of Permaculture solutions. And, they have in fact begun collaborating with projects in The Maldives, Virgin Islands, Africa, and Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;AGRICULTURE &amp;amp; RURAL DEVELOPMENT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/Bhungroo.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot; /&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Sustainable Green Initiative Forum&lt;/strong&gt; has designed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sgifgoon.org&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bhungroo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, (in Gujarati, “straw” or “hollow pipe”), an innovative technology that can filter, inject, and store stormwater up to a depth of 300 meters in the subsoil. Operating in the Gujarat state of India with consultancy-based projects in Bangladesh, Ghana, Togo, and Vietnam, Bhungroo has 17 technical designs for a variety of soil types and agro-climatic zones and can be customized based on 27 variables. Using only 1 square meter of surface area, Bhungroo allows multiple farmers to collectively preserve and retrieve stored rainwater. In an area where female farmers are often disregarded as contributing members of society, this exemplary social enterprise also has a non-profit component that trains women who are smallholder farmers to collectively own the subsoil water stored by Bhungroo and to provide fee-based services to other smallholder farmers in their village, confronting repressive social structures that have dominated the region for 400 years. Their program will be made available to illiterate farmers through the development of an app that utilizes a pictorial format. Bhungroo can equip smallholder farmers to be able to face drought, monsoon flooding, and unpredictable precipitation patterns related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/Ignitia.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: right&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ignitia.se&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignitia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first highly accurate, scalable tropical weather forecasting company, has developed a sophisticated weather model specifically calibrated for the tropics, resulting in hyper-local forecasts that are twice as accurate as other weather forecasting services. Ignitia sends GPS-specific forecasts to farmers via simple SMS so they can make better farming decisions. Nearly 3 billion people live in the tropics, a region where up to 80% of the working-age population make their living from farming, many of them living on less than $2 a day. These farmers struggle to produce enough food because every step in the farming cycle is dependent on weather. Food security is particularly threatened in sub-Saharan Africa where 96% of agriculture is rain-fed, smallholder farmers account for up to 70% of food production, and the crop yields per hectare are the lowest in the world. Currently working in Ghana, Nigeria, and Mali while also sending forecasts to Burkina Faso and Senegal, Ignitia is expanding rapidly. It partners with telcos to send farmers, NGOs, and local organizations daily, monthly, and seasonal predictions. The message is sent in a simple text-lite format, and can be received on any mobile phone (no smartphone required). Farmers subscribe via their mobile operator and pay in micro-installments from their existing mobile credit. It costs just $0.03/message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/SistemaBiobolsa.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sistema.bio&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sistema Biobolsa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; permits small farms, rural communities, and urban settlements to convert organic waste into renewable energy and organic fertilizer. Based on a biomimetic model that originated in the early 20th century, Sistema Biobolsa has re-designed the common bio-digester to provide a state-of-the-art, robust system with a high-quality membrane comprising modular parts that is compact enough to be distributable via donkeys, motorbikes, or boats. This has allowed Sistema.bio to scale to serve farmers in Colombia, India, Kenya, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Senegal and is growing virally, with plans for near global reach. The bio-digesters convert waste into fertilizer for agricultural application and produce natural gas used for clean cooking and heating water, thereby reducing indoor air pollution and combatting deforestation. The gas is also used to run small engines for mechanical and electrical needs, providing affordable, renewable, decentralized energy to hitherto electricity-deprived populations. Sistema.bio places a heavy focus on the monitoring and evaluation of their technology. Their replication package includes technical and communication tools that allow local representatives to track potential waste streams, calculate energy values, order systems and track and report impacts over time. This highly effective project provides a game-changing approach to boosting the livelihoods and well-being of small farmers (who grow 80% of the world’s food).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Fuller Challenge review process is still underway. Finalists will be announced in September and a winner will be announced in October. A 10th anniversary celebration of the Buckminster Fuller Challenge and the conferring of the grand prize will take place in New York City on the weekend of November 10th-12th. The event will be open to the public, so please save the date. You may contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:challenge@bfi.org&quot;&gt;challenge@bfi.org&lt;/a&gt; for further information.

 <title>Fuller Challenge receives record number of entries for 10th anniversary</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/dymaxion-forum/2017/05/fuller-challenge-receives-record-number-entries-10th-anniversary</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2017 Buckminster Fuller Challenge, now in its tenth year, received a record number of entries. To select a winner of the $100,000 grand prize, the jury will review more than 460 submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;We are absolutely thrilled to have received a record number of entries to mark the 10th anniversary of the Fuller Challenge! We had hoped this important milestone would inspire many more people and organizations involved in whole-systems design to participate in the program, and we have not been disappointed. Our review team has started the sorting and initial vetting process, and we are humbled by the breadth and depth of vision for real and positive change reflected in this year’s pool,&lt;/em&gt;” said Elizabeth Thompson, Founding Director of the Fuller Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A world-class team of experts, analysts, and the program’s seasoned review team will vet entries in a rigorous process that will proceed over the next six months. The 2017 Fuller Challenge winner will be announced in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2017 entry pool includes integrated, whole-systems strategies from across the disciplinary spectrum tackling many of humanity’s most entrenched issues. The entries include initiatives in farming, architecture, art, communication, conservation, design, economics, education, energy, healthcare, and urban planning, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the majority of 2017 entrants are new to the Fuller Challenge, 15% of submissions have come from people, groups, and organizations that have participated in prior cycles. The Fuller Challenge welcomes repeat submissions from participants who wish to demonstrate how their work has evolved in relation to the seven criteria by which applications are evaluated. Two prior winners of the $100,000 grand prize were repeat entrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, entrants note that the process of engaging with the Challenge criteria provides invaluable insight and a thoughtful educational experience. We are delighted to share some feedback from the 2017 entrant pool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #EEE; text-align: center; padding: 1em&quot;&gt;
“&lt;em&gt;The application process is rigorous and focused on systemic change, which is very helpful. It is easy in the nonprofit world to get so fixated on tactical decisions that one loses sight of the long-term goal. Your questions about systemic drivers and impacts as well as the one about the preferred state were particularly helpful to sharpen our thinking.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“&lt;em&gt;We appreciated the openness and inclusivity of the application process, as well as the criteria of the Fuller Challenge, which allows for small organizations with small budgets to present big ideas for solving global problems.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“&lt;em&gt;As a concept at an early stage of development, this application has helped refine and hone necessary concepts as well as helped validate the systems approach and multi-disciplinary strategy inherent in the idea.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Fuller Challenge submissions reveal work being done around the world, with 102 countries represented, including: Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burma/Myanmar, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Lesotho, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russia, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Welcoming our 2017 Program Fellow</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/dymaxion-forum/2017/04/welcoming-our-2017-program-fellow</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through our prestigious Fellowship Program, BFI welcomes outstanding early-career practitioners to join the Fuller Challenge Review Committee for four months of the rigorous application review process. The fellowship is designed as an interdisciplinary, collaborative experience, and provides a unique opportunity to contextualize whole-systems thinking through immersion in the Fuller Challenge entry pool. Fellow responsibilities include research, writing, and dialog with BFI staff, partners, and senior advisors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, BFI is pleased to introduce Program Fellow Alicja Walters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alicja is futurist at heart, pursuing her passion for breakthrough solutions for systemic change and new global structures from whole-systems thinking, transportation, clean sources of energy to total city systems. She is engaged with The Venus Project educational program called &#039;Sociocyberneering Education Project&#039; to deepen her understanding of a resource-based economy, a holistic global socio-economic system that works toward a peaceful and sustainable global civilization. She has worked in New York City as a real estate professional for over 6 years, and is a co-founder of the Owning New York LLC (ONY) at The Corcoran Group. Alicja holds Bachelor of Business Administration in International Management from Pace University in NYC and a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance from Nicolaus Copernicus University in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;My understanding of any transformational experience/solution is that it&#039;s linked to consciousness and the interconnection of all there is. Unique transformational journeys help us shift from incremental to exponential mindsets and toward bold, effective action. I&#039;m thrilled to be part of the 2017 Fuller Challenge and working with people who share my commitments, and seeing the work of real game changers living a new cultural story of connection, compassion, and relatedness,&lt;/em&gt;&quot; said Alicja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About The Fuller Challenge Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, BFI invites scientists, planners, designers, architects, entrepreneurs, artists, activists, and students from all over the world to submit solutions for addressing humanity&#039;s most pressing problems. Named &quot;Socially-Responsible Design&#039;s Highest Award&quot;, the Fuller Challenge attracts bold, visionary initiatives focused on critically important, well-defined social and environmental needs. Winning solutions are regionally specific yet globally applicable and present truly comprehensive, anticipatory, integrated approaches to solving complex problems. A $100,000 prize is awarded to support the development and implementation of one outstanding strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About The Fellowship Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fellowship Program is meant to enhance rigorous discourse in the Fuller Challenge review process by bringing additional voices and perspectives into the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fuller Challenge Fellowship is designed to attract engaged students, recent graduates, and early-career professionals from diverse backgrounds and sectors for hands-on experience assessing whole-system design projects. The Fellowship presents an interdisciplinary, collaborative opportunity, as participants will work closely with BFI Staff and the Fuller Challenge Review Team to review hundreds of diverse entries to the Challenge. Fellows will deeply engage with the Challenge criteria and learn how to evaluate proposals using the same rigorous framework across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellows perform independent research, participate in weekly meetings, and aid in tasks related to the Fuller Challenge Interview and Deliberation processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

 <link>https://www.bfi.org/dymaxion-forum/2017/02/enter-2017-fuller-challenge</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are just a few weeks left to enter the 2017 Fuller Challenge! The final deadline is Friday, March 31st at 5pm ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IS THE FULLER CHALLENGE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fuller Challenge has defined an emerging field of practice - the whole-systems approach to understanding and solving the interrelated crises facing us. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge/about/criteria&quot; style=&quot;color: #EC3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;entry criteria&lt;/a&gt; have established a new framework through which to identify and measure effective, enduring solutions to the world&#039;s most entrenched challenges. This year BFI reaches a major milestone as we mark the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/static/email/challenge/2017_Cycle_Dates_Announcement.html&quot; style=&quot;color: #EC3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;10th anniversary of this unique prize&lt;/a&gt;. Want to learn more? Read our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/2017_Call_for_Proposals.pdf&quot; style=&quot;color: #EC3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;2017 Call for Proposals&lt;/a&gt;.
              &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the $100,000 grand prize awarded to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge/winners&quot; style=&quot;color: #EC3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;Fuller Challenge Winner&lt;/a&gt; each year, there are a number of benefits and opportunities associated with entering &quot;socially responsible design&#039;s highest award&quot;. These include additional support and funding opportunities through our &lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge/about/catalyst-program&quot; style=&quot;color: #EC3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;Catalyst Program&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge/media/press-coverage&quot; style=&quot;color: #EC3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;media coverage.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO CAN ENTER?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, the Buckminster Fuller Challenge calls upon individuals and organizations around the world to submit solutions to humanity&#039;s most pressing problems. The program’s seven unique entry criteria and open Call for Proposals attract entrants tackling a wide range of important issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initiatives representing all disciplines will be considered for the $100,000 grand prize, including architecture, urban planning, agriculture, engineering, ecology, food systems, health, sanitation, socially responsible business, energy technology, communications, education, economics, finance, information technology, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning the Fuller Challenge requires more than a stand-alone idea or innovation. BFI looks for visionary, trans-disciplinary solutions that take a whole-systems approach to problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Call for Proposals: The 2017 Fuller Challenge</title>
 <link>https://www.bfi.org/dymaxion-forum/2017/01/call-proposals-2017-fuller-challenge</link>
 <description>
  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York City - January 13, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - The Buckminster Fuller Institute (BFI) formally announces the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/static/challenge/2017/2017_Call_for_Proposals.pdf&quot; style=&quot;color: #EB3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;Call for Proposals&lt;/a&gt; to the 2017 Fuller Challenge. BFI invites innovators who are addressing the many crises facing humanity and the fundamental systems that support life on Earth to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fullerchallenge.submittable.com/submit&quot; style=&quot;color: #EB3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;enter to win the 2017 Fuller Challenge Prize&lt;/a&gt;. For the past decade, The Buckminster Fuller Challenge has been widely regarded as socially-responsible design’s highest award, contributing to advancing whole-systems approaches to solving humanity’s most pressing problems while highlighting and nurturing countless such initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year BFI reaches a major milestone as we mark the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/static/email/challenge/2017_Cycle_Dates_Announcement.html&quot; style=&quot;color: #EB3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;10th anniversary of this unique prize&lt;/a&gt;. We encourage as many people as possible to respond to this call to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fullerchallenge.submittable.com/submit&quot; style=&quot;color: #EB3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;enter the Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, making this year a particularly memorable one. Entering the Challenge with a high-quality application that meets the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge/about/criteria&quot; style=&quot;color: #EB3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;criteria&lt;/a&gt; ensures that your entry will be vetted by a world-class review team, that your work will be promoted to a wider audience, and that you will have the opportunity to win the $100,000 grand prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People from all over the world working in many fields—including science, design, architecture, engineering, education, contemporary art, urban planning, healthcare, socially responsible business, communications, economics, finance, information technology, agriculture, and food systems—are all welcome to enter the Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $100,000 grand prize will support the development and implementation of one outstanding strategy, but the Fuller Challenge offers more than a single financial award. The program aims to leverage further resources for &lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge/winners/finalists&quot; style=&quot;color: #EB3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;finalists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/dymaxion-forum/2016/06/announcing-2016-fuller-challenge-semi-finalists&quot; style=&quot;color: #EB3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;semifinalists&lt;/a&gt;, and select entrants through its network and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/challenge/about/catalyst-program&quot; style=&quot;color: #EB3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;Catalyst Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0;&quot;&gt;THE INSPIRATION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckminster Fuller, who led a life of prolific research, invention, writing, and teaching, was driven by a core idea: he wanted to make the world work for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He coupled this intention with a pioneering approach to solving complex problems that he called &lt;em&gt;comprehensive anticipatory design science&lt;/em&gt;, which emphasizes individual initiative, integrity, whole-systems thinking, scientific rigor, and reliance on nature’s underlying principles. After decades of tracking world resources, innovations in science and technology, and human needs, Fuller clearly saw the scope and intricacy of the challenges facing humanity and he issued an urgent call for a “design science revolution” to develop options to successfully surmount these crises and make the world work for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering this call is what the Fuller Challenge is all about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 17px;line-height: 15px;margin-top: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DEADLINE FOR ENTRY: FRIDAY, MARCH 31st, 2017 17:00 ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 12px;line-height: 15px;margin-top: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Contact: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:challenge@bfi.org&quot; style=&quot;color: #EB3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;challenge@bfi.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0;&quot;&gt;WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge/winners&quot; style=&quot;color: #EB3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;Winning the Fuller Challenge&lt;/a&gt; requires more than a stand-alone idea or innovation. BFI looks for visionary whole-systems solutions that demonstrate both a clear grasp of the “big picture” and a focus on a well-defined need of critical importance. If, for example, your solution emphasizes a new design, material, process, service, tool, or technology, it is essential that it be part of an integrated strategy that simultaneously addresses key social, environmental, and economic factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seek strategies that put forth what Fuller called a &lt;em&gt;preferred state model&lt;/em&gt; – one designed to optimize conditions from inception in order to create the most desirable, sustainable, regenerative future outcome. We also seek solutions that demonstrate what Fuller referred to as the &lt;em&gt;trimtab principle&lt;/em&gt; – that a relatively small initiative inserted into a system at the right time and place can maximize the potential for advantageous change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Initiatives representing a range of development stages may enter – from early stage proposals with completed proof-of-concept to fully operating models ready to expand. Entries can tackle urgent needs at a range of geographic scales – from strategies designed to launch global initiatives tailored to local or regional conditions that can be adapted and replicated elsewhere. Nonprofit, for-profit, and hybrid initiatives all are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bfi.org/challenge&quot; style=&quot;color: #EB3F24;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;Winning strategies must integrate the Fuller Challenge &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;criteria&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
